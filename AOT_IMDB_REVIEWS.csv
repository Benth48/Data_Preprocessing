10,AOT: The Greatest Anime I've Ever Seen,"Attack On Titan is officially over. And nothing will ever be the same.

When I finished Breaking Bad back in 2019 prior to ever watching anime, if someone told me an anime would be on the same playing field as Breaking Bad and even exceed it at times, I would've told them they were crazy. But in reality, I was the crazy one. This story took me places mentally and emotionally I didn't think I could go.

In this dark and cruel world created by Hajime Isayama, while some things are objectively wrong, there's never a moment where you can definitively say that someone's the good guy or bad guy. Once you see the full picture of the show, it's indescribable to explain the show in the manner of good and bad considering how much everyone's in this dark abyss of a gray area that has no objective answer to whom is in the right or wrong. And that's the beauty of AOT.

Attack On Titan is not meant to be joyous. It's a tragedy. It's an unfair world where everyone at some point is given a dirty hand whether they deserve it or not, and the characters have to try and live with that reality and keep moving forward. Now that doesn't mean that there aren't moments where you as a viewer can feel joyous for your perspective favorite character/side because there likely will be, but when you're no longer told the story through this small microscope, you won't be able to see the show the same.

And that's where the absurd genius of the creator Hajime Isayama comes into play. As much as I love the Vince Gilligan's of the world, David Chase, Peter Gould, Jesse Armstrong, David Simon and honestly any writer of any piece of fiction... no one comes close to the creativity that this man has. Isayama is able to create this large world in these small walls surrounded by humanoid creatures that live to destroy and ruin the human race. But as you continue to watch the show, it's like you're peeling an endless onion that doesn't stop, and constantly makes your eyes water and tear up due to the brutality and the absurdity that this universe subjects you to. It will boggle your mind then tear you to shreds in ways that I've never seen before.

The plot twists are second to none. The heartbreak will shatter you to pieces. The betrayals will leave you speechless. The world building will make everything before seem small. And the clashes of different ideals will leave you wondering how you could even pick a side. I could go on all day but to put it simply, the unique story in itself is what brings this all together. And that's not even mentioning things like the voice acting, music, animation, esc. Which are all top tier.

This isn't an anime. This isn't a TV show. This is a fictional masterpiece. And I'm honored and blessed to say that I got to live to see the day where I'd witness the end of it. Thank you, Hajime Isayama. And see you later, AOT.",755,50,"Nov 5, 2023"
10,Masterpiece. I've never witnessed this level of care for every detail.,"The moment you watch this audiovisual masterpiece you will immediately appreciate the level of thought and detail that went into this. From the initial scene that shows you the main and unique weapons to some of the frames that could literally be used as your desktop background or be hanged in your room as paintings. From episode to episode you'll think that you won't be surprised anymore and you'll be wrong again and again, every time I thought an episode or season couldn't be better I was proven wrong. You will get goos bumps from dialog alone and you will lose your mind in the epic fight scenes The characters and their development, the story covered in mystery that unveils beautifully, a dialog carefully written that shows the characters personalities and wisdom., sound design, music, illumination... you'll feel like you are there. The voicing of the characters is excellent... there is nothing below excellent in this. An absolute masterpiece and a bar of quality for any audio visual product to come. Be prepared to care only about Attack on Titan and nothing else, because nothing else will make you feel this way.",1.7K,136,"Jun 19, 2019"
10,Nearly perfect,"Before I started watching this show, I couldn't imagine why it is rated so high. After I finished the first season, I understood. And now, having watched the third season I don't understand, why it isn't rated even higher!

Truly a masterpiece, and deserves to be mentioned on the same page as other fantasy war epics like Lord of the Rings and Game of Thrones. (I dare to say this is even better than those two.) There are countless twist and turns, shocking revelations and heartbreaking moments troughout the series, spiced with great voice acting, beautiful visuals and on top of all: a more than perfect, stunning soundtrack, thanks to Hiroyuki Sawano.

The story is brilliantly written, and does not slow down, not even for a bit. It keeps growing bigger and bigger, while you will find yourself tied to your chair, as you can't watch only one or two episodes. Behind the plot and the action, there is also deeper meaning about war, humanity and questions about moral dilemmas.

Toughtprovoking, exciting and most of all a masterpiece of our time!",1.2K,107,"Dec 17, 2019"
10,My experience as a 42yrs. Old....,"Growing up in the 80's 90's during the time of top anime stories and always getting into arguments with my friends and my son that those were the golden anime era and now I have to admit. This is if not the best story telling I witness in all my years. This show raise the bars with each episode, with unpredictable twist and turns you won't see coming. After completing season 4 mid season finally I must say I'm happy to be alive witnessing a master peace in the making. Can't wait for the finally!",453,50,"Sep 2, 2021"
10,Well deserved to be alongside other greatest TV series ever created,"I'm a more frequent American TV shows watcher than Anime watcher. I have been watching multiple great TV shows in the past 10 years: Breaking Bad, Game of Thrones, Lost, Westworld, The Boys, Dark, House of Cards, Sherlock etc. - just to name a few. Attack on Titan caught my attention one day after I checked the top 250 TV shows on IMDB and saw multiple 10/10 featured reviews from other people, especially considering that it's an anime that is ranked very high on the list.

Hence, I came to AoT with high expectation and after watching it, I'm surprised that it only gets a 9/10. This show is definitely not inferior to Game of Thrones or Breaking Bad, though I understand that being an animated, foreign show means that it has to try much harder to prove its worth.

I find AoT to be almost perfect, and I don't think it's realistic to expect any shows to be perfect. After all, these pieces of arts are all created by human being and we are imperfect! What other reviewers said about AoT is absolutely true: AoT has incredible storytelling, world building, plot twist, foreshadowing, character development and excellent soundtracks. On top of that, I trust the hype also comes from the fact that this show builds such a strongly immersive world for viewers where one can feel being part of its world and understanding the characters' motives and actions. This exerts a strong impact on our feelings and the theme itself is so thought-provoking, which is not something a lot of shows could do. And trust me, I believe I watched enough good series and movies so as not to be easily impressed. On a side note, I don't find the lowest ratings for AoT justified, but rather superficial. Among the lowest reviews I've seen so far on IMDB, none has truly given a critical analysis of why the show is objectively bad - it's either coming from pure haters, those who are too impatient to watch the story in full or those who just don't want to understand the series because of existing bias. Also, any comments saying that AoT is predictable and cliché is the same as saying GoT is predictable too 😊.

The show keeps getting better and better after each season with lots of jaw-dropping twists. As such, I do respect its consistently high quality after 10 years since its first episode and after seeing multiple great TV series starting off well and had degrading quality after a few seasons. There is only 1 episode left and the show so far has only raised the bar after each episode. I know about the ending through the manga and I find it absolutely satisfying. It's considered to be a controversial ending where the fandom is splitted. But I think that's the beauty of this series - it's more real than a live-action show and it correctly depicts the actual world. There is no boundary of good or bad, right or wrong - it's all about perspective.

All in all, a phenomenal journey that I'm utterly grateful to embark on. An absolute 10/10 for this masterpiece - a pity that 10 is all there is to rate.",188,18,"Mar 28, 2023"
10,Greatest Anime,"Review By Kamal K

Story 10/10

It continunes few days after where we left off last season and it focuses more on political drama and dilemmas inside the walls. This season gets straight to the point and introduces new villain named Kenny that turns out to be somehow related to Levi. There are many parties trying to get Eren and Historia. For what reason? It is yet to be reveald. Mystery we all feel in love with is still there and there are even more questions, but don't let that distract you from the fact that this season ,even tho is only few episodes in, already has some major reveals in it. Pacing is amazing and i wasn't bored for a moment while watching. Things are only getting more interesting when Erwin reveals how he's planning to ovethrow the governmant without using the force. This season has a very refreshing and different plot compared to previous ones as we can see from the lack of titans and focuse on the issues inside the walls rather than beyond. However it's still as, if not more interesting than before. There is world buidling,mystery,back stabbing and some major questions answered which there is hopfully more to come.

Animation 10/10

As we can see characters in this season look a little bit different or older which some might not like but i do personally. It's a fresh change. They look closer to their manga designes. Some might notice that they removed those thick black lines around characters faces which made AOT art stand out even more. Don't get me wrong, it still does but that was something that was missing which kept me from giving it 10/10. Animation is brilliant for this season (it's Attack on Titan after all :D) and like every season it only got better. . Perfect combination between 3D background and 2D animation along with masterfull camera movement made this scene look like a movie. There is even one frame where levi is facing the wall and you can see his reflection in the window. Just goes to show how much detail and time was put in to this scene. After i done some research i found out that it took the animator of this scene 1 whole month to complete it. Just that one scene alone. All props to Arifumi Imai. Great job. Hopfully it keeps this quality because this season is said to be 24 episodes long.

Sound 10/10

I mean, is there anything to say? AoT is notorious for it's amazing OST and sound quality. Voice actors are great as always and the sound that stand out to me the most was the sound of falling shell from kenny on the roof in ep.1. It was just so satisfying :D. And again mad props to Hiroyuki Sawano (the composer) for the epic and emotional music.

Characters 10/10

What i like about AoT characters is the fact that they interact so naturally and nothing from their conversation seems forced which is immediately showcased in the very first scene in ep. 1. That cabin scene where jean and eren argue,sasha tries to steal bread, mikasa still does work even tho she's injured and armin cares for her deeply. And of course Levi the clean freak comes in at the end :p They are such fun and lively characters. This season already had some major development for our cast. We got to see Erwin's and Hisotira's backstories which also delved deeper in their characters motives. Both backstories were heartbreaking and made me care a lot more for them. Hisotira is slowly taking of her ""Christa Lenz"" facade (is that how you say it? lol) and Erwin is proving again and again why everyone loves him and would follow him to death. His childhood story is very similar to how our society and governmant wokrs today which is very scary. And we all need to remember that isayama is criticizing this type of government and society with these topics. Instead of just walking of Erwin comes back to Dimo Rivees's wife and comforts her saying he'll avange him. Erwin is charismatic,great leader, intellignet and someone that you just want to follow. Since the young age he was corious and as he call himself a ""gambler"". He is someone that would give everything for the humanity. Or is he? I think there is a lot more to his character. Hange got some development too. Eren is maturing and seems a lot more chill this season but unfortunately he is kiddnaped again :( Poor guy he just can't catch a break. In ep.1 he helps historia to overcome here pain and shows again just how honest he is by telling her ""I like you more this way, just a stupidly normal honest girl"". Also hugeee development for armin. To think that he would be capable of killing a human.. this will deffinitely have a huge impact on his character in the future. The way he selfreflects and his philosohpical speach about morals is great, it really makes you think. He kinda has a point too. He shows one more time how mentally strong he is even tho he lacks physicial strength. This time is just on another level. Now lets talk about our new villain. KENYYYYYYYYYYY. I love this guy lol. The way he roasts and insults levi and the cowboy vibe he gives. I love it. He immediately showcases that he is not a joke by blowing nifa's head off just like that. He also seems very mysterious. The way he treats levi is almost as if he looks down upon him. Speaking of Levi here is what i think: That chase scene where he's running away from kenny is not just a great action sequence it also represents Levi running from his past. Kenny=His past. Running from kenny or his past. This arc is also big development and challange for him now that he has to act as a leader/commander because erwin is absent or busy. There was also some smaller developments for connie (motivating himself to take on the beast titan),jean (struggling to remain human which almost costs him life, also selfreflecting), sanes (showing how he didn't want to do the things that he has done and over the time he just got used to it, also he was kinda easy to symphatise with too and his devotion to king is may be morally wrong but aslo admirable, the way he feels destroyed after finding out that he was actually the one that betrayed the king is also worth mentioning), flegel (stepping up becoming a boss saying how he'll protect the people of his city), zachary (showcasing that he cares more about himself rather than humanity and how he always hated the governmant because they looked up on everyone).

Enjoyment 10/10

I never enjoyed AoT more. It's great.This season has perfect balance between story telling, character development and action.

Overall 10/10",783,115,"Aug 25, 2020"
10,Shinzou wo sasageyo! Devote your heart!,"I'm not an expert of anime. I haven't even read the manga, which I'll do it btw. But I can assure you that attack on titan will keep you interested from the very beginning thanks to a gripping and original plot. There isn't a single boring episode, it's always suspance and action. It may seem a superficial fantasy anime but it actually deals with important topics, such as freedom. Furthermore, the soundtracks are so good that you will start feeling patriotism for an imaginary country.",456,63,"Jun 8, 2019"
10,A historic anime,"Incredible, I honestly have to say that this could be the best anime ever due to its development and plot. Shingeki No Kyojin has one of the best character developments and plot in history (note that this series does not have fill), he even the secondary and third characters have a great importance in the story, but also has that sense of terror, action and drama that by the way is incredibly well done, makes you live the situation that the characters go through and transmit their emotions to you in a very human way. It has an excellent background story that is simply memorable.

Every decision they make is of minor importance to the series and should not be missed, their deaths and the surprise of knowing who are the real antagonists add a magical touch

The first season has a slight start, it ends up being a spectacular season, it is not the best but it is an amazing season with an incredible animation and plot, here you will be introduced to the first antagonist of the series. 9.4/10

The second season I think was epic, this is when you start to see the faces of the real villains (get ready for Senshi Tmp 2 Ep 6 which according to me is the best of the second season, an overwhelming chapter) Shingeki no Kyojin explains it to you perfectly without leaving gaps in the plot, an incredible season. 9.6/10

The third season is truly phenomenal, has a good start and lets you know the problems you will have in a society by not agreeing with something or the difficult decisions you must make to ensure your survival. After this, too many things are clarified without detours, the chapters that stood out most were Perfect Game (Tmp 3, Ep 16), Hero (Tmp 3, Ep 17), Midnight Sun (Tmp 3, Ep 18) and That Day (Tmp 3, Ep 20) (That day has no action or features our main characters, but this chapter amazes me, its development is spectacular and the way they explain everything is overwhelming, honestly, the best development chapter in the history of anime). 9.8/10

Season four is the start of the finale. A season practically perfect, in this season everything comes to light answering every question of the viewer, leaves no gaps in the plot and has a beautiful animation, besides that is incredibly shocking and demonstrates the incredible development in our protagonists, Eren has the best character development I think. For me the best chapters were in my opinion Declaration of War (Tmp 4, Ep 5) (Declaration of War is one of the most impactful chapters of development), The War Hammer Titan (Tmp 4, Ep 6), Assault (Tmp 4, Ep 7), Assassin's Bullet (Tmp 4, Ep 7) (Assassin's Bullet left me speechless...) and Above and Below (Tmp 4, Ep 16), has not yet finished this season, but still for me it is spectacular. 9.9/ 10 This season is the best.

In my opinion your average would be 9.3/10. Sincerely from my point of view, the best anime ever, a work of art from post-apocalyptic fiction.",366,49,"Sep 6, 2021"
10,Genuinely the greatest show I have ever seen,"*NO SPOILERS IN MY REVIEW*

I can't put into words the emotions I felt when watching this show over the course of two months. It honestly completely took over my entire life and personality, and it was all I could think about...

There's never been a show with as many plot twists as this, as deep of emotional connections to the characters through the screen as this, or written greatness as this.

But know that every single detail should not go unnoticed. Every single word that the characters say. EVERYTHING is foreshadowing, and the circular storytelling is revolutionary like no other.

Hands down, this is the most incredible show with incredible characters, storytelling, and attention to detail. Do yourself a favor and immerse yourself in this story.",21,0,"Nov 26, 2024"

As it has only 9 episodes as of now ... many critics say that it is way too early to rate an anime. But, according to me, this is pure class. The soundtrack's tempo varies according to the situation and this makes it more exciting. The ending of the episode is something that NO one will look forward to as NO one will want it to end. A must watch for every anime lover and of course the manga is available as well. Although a bit gory, the epicness makes up for it!

6,Disappointing in the Best Way,"Season 1: 7/10

This is probably the best the show ever was, despite all the anime-isms that make parts of it hard to take seriously. It's exciting, it's mysterious, and it does a fantastic job of setting the tone.

Season 2: 6/10

This season is fine, it strays from the first season's tone a bit more than I'd like and it's full of conversations between major characters that the audience has zero context for, making this is a frustrating season to watch. On top of that, what should've been one of the show's biggest reveals is extremely downplayed to the detriment of the season.

Season 3: 5/10

I'm very mixed about this season. It's divided into two distinct arcs, the first of which is awful and the second of which is nearly the same level of quality as the first season. The structure and pacing of the first arc is terrible, the villains are bland and either not fleshed out at all or too late for the audience to care. The second arc of this season, however, is exciting and much more important to the overall narrative of the show. It still fails to perfectly recapture the tone of season one, but it's very good. The first arc is a 3/10 and the second if a 7/10, so rating-wise I took the average.

Season 4: 6/10

This season was difficult to get through for me, not because it was bad but because it was so different, There was so much information, and there were so many new characters and conflicts. It was a lot, but I think in the end it mostly worked. Not every new character or plot thread mattered in the grand scheme of things, while others mattered a lot and significantly impacted the narrative. The animation style was also very different this season and unfortunately it was to the show's detriment.

Overall, I like this show a lot, but it has some significant problems. My biggest complaint was that the tone was set perfectly in season one, then largely abandoned for the rest of the series. Despite this, the show is exciting, the music and animation is (mostly) great, and the characters are well-realized and fun to watch.",100,214,"Oct 29, 2015"
4,One of the best ever,"Season 4 is halfway through already, and I have gone back once again to re-watch the previous seasons, and it truly is a masterpiece on all levels. I had to pause S1E06 just now to write this review as 9 minutes into that episode had me crying again.

I have been watching AoT since 2013, eagerly awaiting each new episode and season, and it's hard to believe the series is ending very soon. ""Don't be sad that it's over, be happy that it happened"", and all that...

For a time my top 3 running shows were GoT, Vikings, and AoT. Sadly, GoT collapsed before the finish line, Vikings slowly fizzled out in quality after its fourth season, yet Attack on Titan has held strong and not only remained brilliant, but actually improved in many ways as the show progressed, which is incredibly rare.

I still to this day listen to the amazing soundtrack while doing other things, and each time I return to watching the show, it's hard to pinpoint anything bad about it really. And I know some people will say that AoT is overrated, and I might have thought that at some points in the show also, such as at various points in Season 2 and 3, but when you see how it all connects together and makes overall sense in the macro, some seemingly weaker aspects or things that appear nonsensical, overly contrived or dramatized at the time, make sense upon revisiting it, or at least that was my experience.

Anyway, I would give Attack on Titan a 10/10 simply because it is so intensely watchable, engaging, inspiring, epic, thought-provoking, anti-war, spine-chilling, horrifying at times, emotional and tear-inducing.

If you liked the early seasons of Game of Thrones, Vikings, Breaking Bad, Fullmetal Alchemist, and other similar shows, then Attack on Titan is indeed for you.

Now to slowly endure the agonising anticipation for each new and final episode of the last season...

10,1 episode left..,"Ive been watching this show since 2016, and I wanted to write a review for it but I couldn't because with every new episode i have a mixed feelings and i can't determine where am i from this show. But now, with only 1 episode left, i can finally write whats in my heart.

In AOT, you dont have to support the ""good"" against the ""evil"", because simply there's no such thing in this world. Usually, an any work whether if its a movie, tv show or an anime, there's sides and you as a viewer have the choice to support whatever you like good or bad. Most people choose the good side, some choose the bad one. This type of work represents almost 75% of all the works out there. So some of us have adjusted to the idea of good and bad sides.

The other 25% are shows, movies and animes like AOT, they are psychologically complexed with a lot of twists and most importantly no good or bad sides. These kind of animes describes the world and our reality in such a scary truthful way, it mixes your emotions and feelings and you dont know what to think, makes you consider a thousand time before calling a character good or bad, this is AOT.

After completing most of the show i can say, that AOT reached a high level of realism. That you dont have to determine in which side are you.

One advice for anyone who hasn't saw AOT or is still in the beginning, dont take sides, just enjoy the anime because I believe its the best anime in the world.",393,61,"Mar 25, 2022"
10,The Greatest Animanga of all Time,"Attack on Titan is the king of world building and plot. With ultra realistic consequences missing from a lot of animation, Attack on Titan stands out as it has an incredibly dark world with actually stakes. The aspects of horror and adrenaline when there's an action scene is stellar. The characters, action and music could carry episodes but don't have to because the show is already that good. Characters have depth and feel like real people, they die constantly and never feel 100% safe. The action is some of the best action in any show. Mystery aspects make even moments that could come off as bland feel so much more impactful. This is perhaps one of the best stories ever written. The Music makes this epic world feel vast and important, while also sounding phenomenal.

And I understand why. The Plot is so well written, you won't even know the real storyline until season 3 or whatever. On the outside it seems a pretty simple story. Demons vs humans. Who will win? That is hardly the story at all... and even thinking that, I watched through the first 2 seasons. And even then I was hooked because of great story building and great great climaxes and actions and all. I thought season 1 ending was insane. Then season 2 came. I thought It was even crazier. Then season 3! A literal masterpiece... specially the second arc. and the 4th season is expected to be God Level. And I expect nothing less from the greatest anime of all time. That's how good the story is! It's complex yes. Greatest Plot I have ever seen on a show. I love breaking bad, I love Avatar the last air-bender, I love Game of thrones. But The story line, music, and the voice acting are all 10/10 easily. Do yourself a favor, don't judge it by it's cover, get through some quality anime till you reach God level story telling.

This anime is way better than rick and morty, way better than even game of thrones, but the ppl in charge of imdb give it a way lower ratings than those two?......balls. This anime deserves a lot more respect.",424,75,"Jun 6, 2020"
10,Master of Storytelling,"I am not the regular anime fan, I've seen some really good ones but Attack on Titan sits on a whole other level of amazing writing.

The way the story unfolds is so well written and engaging, that I was hooked since the first season where the plot seemed to be a very basic revenge story between humans stuck living inside mysterious walls and their nemesis, humanoid titans which seems to exist with the sole purpose of eating humans alive.

It's hard to make a detailed review without giving up on spoilers, I've shared the premises, but Attack on Titan is so much more than that... From the parallelisms with the real world depicting themes like war, greed, complacency, the inherit curiosity for exploration all the way to the grey characters and their respective development, I can only say good things about this anime.

Ambiguity is an ever present concept in our lives, and this show depicts it like very few do, this associated with how brilliant the characters evolve throughout all 4 seasons its remarkable, you can empathize with someone that made the most awful things and that shows how brilliant the creator is.

Adding to all the above, you will be facing many mind blowing twists and unexpected dark turns on the story, with one of the best animation work I've ever seen on screen, specially the most recent episodes - considering this started almost 10 years ago!

Outstanding soundtrack, I get the chills on many of the fight scenes and of course it goes without saying that the fights themselves are brilliant, nerve wracking and make you so hyped with all of the elements of the action combined, really a one of a kind TV show.

I am eagerly waiting for the final part next year I don't know if it wraps up badly but up until this point it's a flawless masterpiece and I don't say that lightly.

EDIT AFTER SERIES FINALE: It's quite the challenge to say the least to end a series like this one, after having watched the final episode I can safely reinforce how much of a masterpiece this anime is.... The message in the end transcends entertainment, it's a timeless lesson and it is scary how close to reality it is. It's almost impossible to get into detail without writing a full script so I'll leave it at this; this is one of the best TV shows ever created, don't take my word for it go binge it now that it wrapped up!",215,37,"Apr 4, 2022"
10,How Animes Should Be,"A well made anime. The feel this show gives is just awesome. I always want more of it and one episode a week is just so not fair. Right now I am on 20th episode and it's really getting better.

How action and emotions connects and make a perfect atmosphere for Titans, monsters who like to eat humans just for fun, and humans, fighting for their existence when stuck inside three walls.How main characters who aren't super powerful yet give a promising touch to the show. And how they show a real management work even when their is anger, fear and blood in the air.

Characters are super cool and feel real unlike regular animes. This show is a guarantee of entertainment. Give it a try.",248,46,"Aug 25, 2013"
10,The most INCREDIBLE show i have ever watched.,"Now that it's nearing it's part 1 ending, i'm so not okay. Binge-watched the whole show in a week or two and it's absolutely phenomenal. To be honest, i haven't even read a single chapter of AOT (Manga). And yet i've become a huge fan of this show. I'm waiting for part 1 to end (although i never wish it to end), so that i can read it completely all 33 Volumes. I could've read it before watching the anime but i hesitated. Because i wanted to know what it'd be like to watch this without reading the Manga.

It's incredible how they managed to make it so special. This show is one of the greatest i have seen. I have watched almost 30 tv shows including Breaking Bad and Game of Thrones in the last couple of years. They were both an amazing show, had huge impact on viewers and general audiences. At the time, for me, GOT was the best of the best. But when i watched this, i'm kinda gradually giving it to AOT. Because it's perfect, every season and almost every episodes.

Although i got a glimpse of what is to come in the next episode. But i didn't read it completely. Still waiting to read. Anyway, i can't wait for the next one, ""Savagery"" to come out. It's going to be beyond epic. I'm quite sure. I'd have rather rated this more than 10 if it was possible.

10,Amazing!,"This anime just keeps me on the edge of my seat. Each week I watch and each week I want more. It's intense. The concept and story line are on point and keep you thrilled and wanting more. The only downside is the seven-day waiting for the next episode. Definitely one of the best anime I have seen.

I often watch anime for fun and as a means of passing the time away but with this it's different. I can't tear my eyes away for even a second. A masterpiece in the making. I just hope the producers keep this running for longer instead of cutting it short into a 20-something episode thing such as SAO or BTOOOM!.

Do yourself a favor and follow it.",311,62,"Apr 28, 2013"
10,Don't watch it...,"...if you want to enjoy another movie or series in life.

WTH. Character development, plot, action, mystery and fascination all on point. This masterpiece is scary in a good way. I watch a lot of movies and series, but rarely it touches one of the aspects of this series. You will hate characters and understand them, you will have heroes and question them and they will question their actions themselves. Not like marvel where everything clear after 1min of the trailer. Much more like real life. This has so many levels its just good. Every dialog is just gold. Even if you think ""oh wow now hes whining"", some other character says exactly that. I never had a side story in this series where i thought, come on i want to see the others. Also the details in this show are crazy good. There are banners here and there where they explain in detail the tools they use and other stuff, crazy.

Now lets not only praise it. Lets be real. You will pay weird streaming apps just to watch this. You will be awake at 2 am on working days. You will be very sad watching the last season knowing it will be over soon. Is it worth? Short.... yes. And don't binge watch this like me. Sip it like a good *wine*. But be careful with the wine ;).",40,4,"Jul 2, 2021"

10,Awesome just Awesome,"I've seen all kinds of animes, mostly adult ones because usually they have a better story then kid shows, and I had nothing left to watch so i googled 2013 animes and this one seemed slightly interesting, watched a trailer first and didn't like the trailer, watched the 1st episode and I was hooked, watched the 2nd and i was totally hooked, watched the 3rd and it blew my mind, now I will have to wait every week for an episode daaamn, the first 3 episodes of this anime prove that this anime will be an awesome one, you can foretell that by watching how the first episodes is building up this hype-level of an awesome story which started out sad and is going to become epic and bloody. The concept is unique and I like it. Humans who live inside 50 meters high walls to protect themselves from titans (giants), Eren the main character feels unpleasant about it compared to everybody else because that's not really true freedom for a human to be ""livestock"" inside walls, waiting to get eaten by titans. One day, and that would be the day they would all remember for eternity, the day when first wall fell and hell broke loose, this is where the story starts. And it just gets better and better! There's a lot of emotional and bloody scenes which usually makes up for a good story. You know those animes that catch your eyes on the first episode, this is one of them.",366,77,"Apr 24, 2013"

10,The most amazing anime I´ve ever seen!,"This anime grabbed me in the first episode and it didn´t release me to the end. I´ve seen all the episodes several times but it still can make me feel like for the first time. It has gripping story, fantastic music and really good animation. Someone can tell that animated serials are for children so if you have one of these people in your friendlist, tell them about this anime. It´s full of blood, gore, cutted extremities and death so they will probably change their mind. The serial stars Yûki Kaji (Eren Yeager), Marina Inoue (Armin Arlert), Yui Ishikawa (Mikasa Ackermann) and many other good voice actors and actress. In the story main characters and other people live in the town surrounded by tall walls. The walls protect people from some kind of creepy humanoid monsters called titan. And those titans really like to kill and eat humans so there are much violent too. But you can´t look at this anime only in bad way. It´s also about friendship, loyalty and many strong feeling made between people in hard situations. It´s about the will of life, political intrigues, freedom and amazing fights against human eating creatures. This anime is great work and nobody can change MY mind.",276,59,"Jan 25, 2019"

10,So about that manga ending...,"Probably we've all seen at this point all the manga readers dump on the ending of Attack on Titan, however, don't let yourselfs be fooled, it is the minority that's the loudest here.

The ending of Attack on Titan fits the story perfectly. While the execution might have been weak on some parts, and the last few chapters might have been a bit rushed, they are not Game of Thrones. They don't throw away all that AOT has done so far, it only enhances the messages the Final Season will show you later on. Attack on Titan might have small issues with execution here and there, but the story is so special, that thinking something like this throws away all that is quite foolish.

The Final Season Part 2 will be the thing, that will solidify Attack on Titan, as one of the greatest stories ever written.

(Little edit: it seems there's a good chance the anime is not getting finished with part 2, and we'll either have to wait for a part 3 or a movie, but what I said I still stand by)",100,18,"Oct 6, 2021"

Firstly the music and voice acting are seriously good, and the art/animation is top notch, very nice indeed. Then regarding the story line - right from the off we get deep into the scenario, the characters, and their fear. The anime does an amazing job of portraying the characters emotions, you really get the sense of how much of a helpless position the humans are in. Quite a lot has happened already in these first 6 episodes, with already some shocks and unexpected events. Really has been an incredible start to this anime, and that is what I have rated it on, though I have extremely high confidence this one will be one that gets better and better.",170,36,"May 18, 2013"

10,Excellent Anime,"Animation - absolutely incredible, fluid, not blocky, crazy camera angles, and very good character designs and animated facial expressions.

Music - reeeeally epic, well-timed, and really epic

Voice Acting - almost perfectly done All characters' voices fit and really give them extra definition to each character. Armin and Eren in particular have the most expressive voices that have produced some of the best voice acting performances I've ever seen that really does outshine most other characters in anime.

Story - Rich background and story world, incredibly grim, this story is a lot more complicated than the premise introduced in Episode 1.

Plot - how the story is presented in the form of an anime definitely keeps you interested for wanting more. If you're not seeing action, you're seeing emotional breakdowns, controversial issues, showcases of characters and character interactions, etc. The pacing of the series is good, there's always something interesting going on or something interesting we as an audience want to know, and there's ALWAYS conflict after conflict, the humans really can't catch a break.

Characters - realistic, emotional, and some really interesting, basically just imagine a normal person like yourself in the shoes of the cadets.",152,36,"Jun 28, 2013"
10,Mind Blowing!!,"The show conveys every emotion well, making it easy for fans to get attached to the characters. With death around every corner, you can hear the fear and sadness the characters feel.

Even awkward situations - like the embarrassment of telling your crush how you feel - are well captured in the show. You can't help but sympathize with the characters because they seem so human. Paired with the high level of character development, you truly build a strong bond with your favorite characters.

Overall, there is very little to complain about the show other than the fact it is ending. It is worth all the sleepless nights and elevated stress levels incurred with every episode. Even if you are not a fan of action-packed shows, you will still appreciate the drama and suspense built into every episode.

I could talk about how is one of the few animes that have transcended its own medium, garnering mainstream attention, but that only speaks about the show's popularity. What makes this show so special is its story, and the way the narrative evolves throughout 4 seasons, elevating the stakes, while always mantaining the same core themes, particularly the fight for freedom.

The music, the plot twists, the nuanced characters, the animation and the amazing cinematography provided by both Wit Studio and Studio Mappa, helped to position AOT as not only one of the best animes of all time, but quite possibly one of the greatest stories ever told.",11,0,"Aug 1, 2024"

10,If theres is a show that can be called PERFECT thats definitly Attack on Titan,"Put it simply this is the PINNACLE of plot, story and storytelling !!! Animation is top tier , thanks to Hiroyuki Sawano ( the composer ) and company the MUSIC its 1000/10 as well as there is not a single bad OSt ( same goes for the OP/ED ). Same can be said for the characters as they are written exceptionally + theyr Voice actors(Japanese) give theyrs all for the roles they play . From the first arguably best first episode in fiction to the last there is not a single bad or boring episode as every little detail is connected and every next keep getting better and better and exceeds your expectations.

My overall rating !!

Story- 1000/10 there is no better story told to this day !!!

Music- 1000/10 For me comes at first place ( with Naruto one come second close )

Characters - 10/10 The themes, parallels , dynamics, ideologys everything is simply top tier !

Animation - 9/10 With WiT studio beside CGI titans everything was beautiful , the scenery the visuals, action etc... , but with coming of the second studio in the face of Mappa studio quality dropped drastically .

Enjoyment - 1000/10 Once u experience Aot nothing is the same again and the bar is set way too high.

Season ratings !

S1- 9 One of the best introduction to a show

S2- 9.5 Top 3 plot twists ever

S3- 1000/10 Best season for a show . As the first part was heavy on dialog and politics with almost no action the storytelling goes wild .For the second part its the other way around as action is the leading factor with less dialogs we have one of the greatest eps in the face of Perfect game 3x16 , Hero 3x17 and Midnight sun 3x18 (greatest stretch of eps) and for closing the season we have 3x20 That day which left all of us in shambless !

S4 - 1000/10 No words needed . Best plot twist in fiction.

10,"A thrilling, action-paced anime, with alot of heart.","Backstory Review: This show is fantastic, but let me give you a little backstory on my opinian with anime.. Sonic X was the first anime I ever watched. I was 7 years old and loved it, but it didn't really get me into anime. I then started watching the Beyblade Metal Saga and liked it, but again, that didn't get me into anime. After seeing alot of youtube videos and hearing people go on and on about this show, I decided to give it a shot. It was the teens react video that got me to watch this show. And right from the opening scene, I knew deep down that this show was going to be amazing and I was right. After watching the first season back in 2014, I decided to check other animes out and give them a watch. These were Naruto, Death Note, Fullmetal Alchimist Brotherhood, Hunter X Hunter, Bleach,, Erased, Cowboy Bebop, Sword Art Online, Durama, Gunslinger Girl, Black Lagoon, My Hero Academia and now just recently, Black Clover. Some of these shows were actually really good. I really liked Erased, Death Note, Full Metal BrotherHood, and Naruto, minus the filler. But after rewatching the Attack on Titan anime in subbed, I was truly shocked to find out that despite all the animes I have seen, Attack on Titan is still the best.

Anime Review: Attack on Titan is about humanity being surrounded by large stone walls that keep out titans. However, the largest titan humanity has ever seen has destroyed the walls and all hell breaks lose. The lead character, Eren Jeager vows to kill all the titans after they destroyed his hometown and together with his childhood freinds Armin Arlet and Mikasa Ackerman, join tthe 104th Scouts and eventually the survey corps. WHat this shows does is that it starts off peacefull and normal, having the same tropps from regualr anime and flips it on it's head. The true horror and brutallity these titans cause will give you nightmares. The plot maybe simple, but it is exucuted in a manor that is unthinkabale, in a brilliant way. The shows is possibly the only show I have seen in anime were the supporting cast are just as interesting and likable than the main. All with their own story to tell. The animation and visuals are the best I have seen in anime tv seires. The soundtrack is amazing ans well as the voice acting. I will admit that I did start off this show watching it in english dub, as that was how I always watched anime. But 4 years later, I decided to rewatch the whole show in japanese in time for season 3 and I must say that the original japanese voice acting enhances the Attack on Titan experiance. The english dubbing isn't half bad. I felt like, at first that the english voice worked bette ron the characters than the japoanese voice, particuallty Eran, Armin and Mikasa. But watching it in japanese, throughout, I can saftely say and recommned you watch this show in Japanese with english subtitles. I found out that some lines and dialogue can come accros 'cringy' and 'screechy' in english but it doesn't feel that way in japanese. It feels very natural. But you can decide which is better.

Conclusion: I know that this is a very long review, but II could have talked for hours on why you need to watch this show, but I don't want to spoil so much. All I can say without spoiling the show is that "" not all is what it seems to be"". The shows goes in completely different directions that I orignannly thogut that I thought I was going mad. The plot thickens as you get deeper and deeper. After You watch season 1, 2 and the new season 3, read the manga becuase the plot thikens even more and you don't want to be spoiled. Overall, a brutally beautiful anime, with stunning visuals, a stella cast, both japanese and english and has posibly the best soundtrack in an anime, with wondeful editing. I thank the autor and writer of Attack on Titan, Hajime Isayama for writhgn this brutally beautiful series and the director of the anime, Tetsuro Araki for directing this and the onscreen writer, Yasuko Kobayashi for adapting the manga for the small screen and composer, Hiroyuki Sawano for the wondeful soundtrack. Also, thanks to the cast and crew and especially the Wit Studio and Production I.G for animation this wondeful anime. I 100% strongly agree you watch this show. :)",115,27,"Jul 18, 2018"
9,Absolutely fantastic!,"I am not much of an Anime buff, sure I watched my fair share when I was a teenager but most Animes simply do not grab as much as I would like. There is of course Akira and Ninja scroll and stuff like that people in general should watch at least once in their life. The only Anime TV show that I watched from the beginning was Fist of the North Star. A real classic in my opinion.

Seems like I found another show that I consider already a classic in the making. I am proud to say after watching 3 Episodes of <>Attack on Titan<> I am blown away. The show is nicely paced, the whole plot is so simple, yet strong and the whole concept of having the human race, that consist of mostly German people or so it seems, locked up behind walls is really, really compelling.

The art is superb and a joy to watch. From the Bavarian town over to the great painted landscapes, character design etc. It is all top notch in my opinion.

Stuff like the charging Armored Titan is even for an old timer like just to cool to pass up. What a great scene that was. I cannot wait for the next episode.",226,64,"Apr 28, 2013"
10,Gets better as time passes,"At the time of this review, there are currently 57 episodes in the series (2 left in the current season 3). What can I say about this show? The first season starts with a bang, but then suffers from a jarring change of pace. However, once the second season starts, you will find yourself gripped by the storytelling. That's not to say the first season is bad -- it is very entertaining in its own right. In fact, how the first season is laid out sets you up perfectly for the story to come.

The show is not afraid to explore different genres and doesn't rely on gimmicks or shock value to keep you hooked. Each episode improves upon the last until you eventually get to the point where every episode is a 10/10. Every person should be watching Attack on Titan, it is a masterpiece in the making. Just make sure you don't google anything about the show - it's the most spoiled show on the internet.",68,15,"Jun 18, 2019"
10,There was a LOT of love put into this.,"Oh, where to start.

The music. The writing. The visuals. So much to take in. If some genius is able to make this into a successful live action thing, they'd have made history.

I've been into Anime since Science Team Ninja Gatchaman (Known in America as, ""Battle Of The Planets,"" back then). When I was told about AOT, I didn't think much of it. Then, after starting a fresh bottle of tequila, I started from the first episode: ""To You, in 2000 Years."" WOW. Just WOW. The heartbreak. Hitting the viewer with the intensity of any child's love for their Mother.

The viewer will live the characters' lives. The pains and regrets. The growth and the losses.

This is an amazing show.

I think what really made this show different from other shows is its way of describing reality of deep human nature that lies beyond human conscience.

10,Wow,When I first heard of attack on titan I didn't really know what it was but I knew it was a anime and I had always thought of anime's as weird shows for nerds but this one struck my eye and I decided to watch it let me tell you this was my best decision ever this show is better than breaking bad snowfall better call sal any show in my opinion with the character development with Erin yager through his grit and hard times this show has everything you could ask for plot twist fight scenes even the music is perfect without spoiling anything attack on titan is a show that shows the struggles of humanity and its whole it shows what would happen if humanity had a limiting factor like the titans though being and anime this is the best show of all time and if this manga was a novel and not a book it would be one of the best selling books of all time and would be known world wide I just simply can't explain it attack on titan is that good watch it atleast the first few episodes I would pay any amount of money to rewatch it for the first time if the show gets slow and you want to stop watching I promise it's just a slow patch keep going it's that good.,10,0,"Dec 6, 2024"

It was a bit boring at first but as the events unfolded... by season 2, It was one of my favorite animes. But oh my! The season 3 part 2 was by far the best arc i have ever seen in a anime and it changed the whole story! I loved every second of its masterpiece and the season 4 trailer has me so much excited!",31,5,"Aug 18, 2020"
10,At first I was sceptical. Until I watched the first episode.,"The first time I heard about this show was when I was not into anime until I was told by my friends that I should try it and that I'm missing out.

To tell you the truth, I was really missing out and I'm greatful that I have been recommended this series! I remember watching the first episode and being all sceptical that I wouldn't like it, however from that moment the Colossal Titan attacked Wall Maria I was absolutely hooked!

It's quite an extraordinary and emotional journey if one watches this series episodically on a daily basis. I laughed, I cried, I cheered, it was something rare! I can't believe how perfect and intricate this series' plot is. There are so many twists and the stakes are raised everytime which ultimately always leads to an emotional payoff at the end of every season!!

I'd recommend this series to anyone and I'd thank my friends for recommending this one and for being so annoying about it. I wouldn't change a thing! I'd give anything to be able to relive the experience of watching it all over again for the first time!!

Go watch it! If you haven't, you're missing out and shame on you, (according to my friends).",23,3,"Jan 10, 2022"
10,This anime is truly a masterpiece,"I have seen 200+ anime, but also movies and many series. I have to say, this anime is truly amazing. The characters are so well written, and the story is a masterpiece, not only that the anime is really deep and meaningful, but it will certainly change how you see the world. It deals with many important topics such as freedom, racism and trauma. Furthermore, I was impressed to find out that unlike most anime, Shingeki no Kyojin/ Attack on titan includes multiple characters that are not Japanese ( Eren Jeager, Erwin...). There is NOT A SINGLE episode that is boring, and it always surprises you in so many ways, such as HUGE PLOT TWISTS, which are truly amazing, and it also slips a few hints about what will happen next ( which are really discrete, but when I watched it for the second time with my friends, I couldn't stop laughing when seeing how many hints there were!)It is truly impressive, honestly the best anime I have ever seen, it made me laugh, cry, and even start shaking because it was really full of adrenaline ( for example Erwin saying Shinzo wo sasageyo which means ''devote your hearts'' and everyone following him... Haha, that made me really happy)

Bonus: Thank you, Hajime Isayama. You have my respect.

Respect for those who haven't gotten spoiled, those who avoided the spoilers, and those who didn't read the final manga, but waited for the anime to release. You have my repect.

Thank you to those who have watched this masterpiece, you are truly blessed. You have my respect.

Plus, how the hell you compare this ending to Got?

If you ever tried to watch it carefully, you would have understood that Isayama thought about this final since the first chapter. What the hell did you want?

10,Outstanding Anime! Made it to my top favorites!,"I have to give this anime a 10 our of 10! Ever since the first 2 episodes, which was in my opinion one of the best hook-on I have seen, it was very intense and conveyed fear to the viewers very well. Some people complain that it has gotten slow or was boring in some episodes, but I don't think they fully grasp how important each episode is. First I think ever since the first 2 episodes, it made people raise their standards and expected more and more action every time. The show does an amazing job on building character and storytelling in general. I doesn't have to have action all the time just for it to be good. This anime is top-notch! The money and time they invested in this Manga adaption was well done! Excellent! Animation is beautiful! Whatever the effect they use for the Tian's animation is also nice. My next obsession is the soundtracks! I am so glad Hiroyuki Sawano helped worked on it. He is a highly valued music composer that is remarkable at making one of the most epic soundtracks, such as Gundam UC: Unicorn. The Manga's content was a lot more gory, but they adapted it and censored it in a way that did not ruin the story. Voice over is also excellent! Expresses feelings and other emotions strongly and effectively.",119,34,"Sep 21, 2013"

10,A Humble Review,"Reluctant to watch it? Afraid anime isn't your thing? Don't worry i was the same. Watching it changed me, it's not about bug eyed princesses and screaming comedy. Attack on Titan has depth and story, emotion and loss. As well as keeping that action epic you crave for. It's story excells season by season and leaves you wanting more, some episodes may leave you overwhelmed, some may make you cry. Season four makes this show untouchable now, but it could be confusing. Do the homework, watch from the beginning you won't regret it. Also i just want to say i didn't find a single episode in this series that bored me and that's rare.

My personal rating for each season:

(Season One- 9.0)

(Season Two- 9.7)

(Season Three- 9.9)

(Season Four- Hopefully a 10, so far so good)

Let's not compare it to top shows like Breaking Bad, but it totally deserves to be by it's side. It is and always will be, one of the best shows i've ever watched.",62,15,"Feb 1, 2021"

10,EMOTIONAL,"FOR SEASON 3 (10/10)

The first half of the third season of ""Attack on Titan"" was a bit disappointing. Featuring politics and a lot of necessary backstory that mainly focused on Historia and the origins of Titans, it felt like a 12-episode story that could have been told with 6-8 episodes. However, what Part 1 lacked, Part 2 more than over compensated with its action packed episodes, a certain, depressing decision that Captain Levi had to make, and that emotional ending.",71,18,"Jan 30, 2022"
10,"So detailed, complex and immersive character and world creation.","This anime has one of the most intense, detailed and unique characters. Normally the characters evolving, changing and that makes you love the characters that once you hate. Like Jaime Lannister, he's changing slowly and so good. You're loving him more every season. But in Attack on Titan, you are loving them because you're realizing they were right. They didn't change, only you realized what's going on. You were assuming some character was the great villain. But in this immersive anime, don't be sure that much. I know some characters are changing. Their motivations and purposes are changing, that could also make you feel like that but most of the times it isn't the characters, the world is changing. The anime gives the meaning to their purpose.

There is so much characters with different motivations. Some of them even fights themselves but you nearly like them all. How can any story make you love the both sides?

Attack on Titan has so special and unique world design. I don't know any similiar world design. From the first season to the end, you are just exploring another universe, And because of how well it's written, you're finding it stunning.

These are why this anime is so special. Even an anime hater could like this easily.

The drawings are got better in every season. In my opinion drawings was a bit weak in the first season. In the next seasons the drawings evolved to another level. Also Voice Acting Performances are quite amazing as you know. They have chosen really well.",43,9,"Mar 13, 2023"

At first, you wonder whether these people are living in an apocalyptic world but the twists and turns are great. It also has very minimal room for error as every dot is connected well, leaving no plot holes (there might be a few I didn't notice).

10,The greatest show of 21 century!,"Characters, music, plot... I wouldn't know where to start. I used to watch anime and series during all my life, but I stopped firmly because everything was just overhyped for no reason and ended up in the worst possible way most of the time. But this, this is the product of a super human. I can't believe all the goosebumps I get watching every single episode. Every detail, even the smallest one, is in its place, accurate, well prepared. I cannot even think the hard work that has to be behind this masterpiece. Nonetheless, what surprised me the most was the whole story, it's insane, it's unimaginable to be honest, an endless twist (A COUP DE THEATRE!!!).

I pray and hope that as many people as possible could watch it and enjoy. Attack on titan overcomes the concept of series or anime, and stands right in an higher level, alongside with Breaking Bad (The only show which comes to my mind that gets close). Out of any ranking.

6,Why I did not rate it a 9,"If I was to rate this show purely on the quality of the animation, I would have rated it an 8, a 9? Maybe. As the quality of animation goes, it is pretty solid and doesn't give any reason to complain. That said, it is not surreal or anything. It is good. Solid.

The stars have been docked for several reasons which I am going to succinctly list.

1. Long previews of previous episode, plus an extra long opening and end credits. These take away almost 5 minutes of a 25 minutes show, and after a few episodes, they are grating.

2. Too many asides. The story relies heavily on lines spoken by characters to the audience, and they are not succinct. They are repetitive, tedious, and verbose.

3. Lacks a strong story line. The story is pedestrian and predictable and once again, very repetitive. There is barely anything that will make you wait for the next episode.

4. The characters are flat and you absolutely do not connect or feel for them even towards the end.

If you want to watch an anime that you do not have to pay attention to while you are doing something else, this is great.

Favorite Chapter (not aired yet): From you 2000 years ago

This will go down in TV history. It's the greatest shonen anime I've seen. The soundtrack, story, animation, art style, and voice actors are all at a masterpiece level. Tons of callbacks, the logic is very tight. It's obvious this took 13 years of writing, the story was meticulously planned from the very first chapter. Aside from some overdramatization in Season 1, the flaws are negligible. After reading the manga I can easily say it's the most well-executed media I've ever consumed (As of Jan 2021).",58,14,"Jan 23, 2021"
7,Has a good start but looses itself during the progress,"So ""Attack on titan"" has been recommended by a friend of mine who has great taste for TV series and naturally I have given it a try. I really loved how the first scenes set the tone for a more ""mature"" and less chlichéed picture of women I so came to hate about anime (you know .. those animes in which women have so unrealistic huge breats it hurts and they always wear awfully short stuff to show every viewer how desperately lonely the creator of the manga must have felt). The pacing felt right at first and it sure knows how to make you feel excited for some twist which reveals what happened, where the titans come from and so on. Sadly like 6 episodes in you start to realize that while an episode is 24 minutes long roughly 18 of those are wasted on flat emotional melodramtic talking I start to feel Japanese are addicted to. To make things even worse they started adding some unlikeable characters that are not just ""unlikeable"" for the audience in a clever way but are designed to be unlikeable in a shameful way (yeah, we get it, rich people try to save their goods and sacrifice every normal citizen who comes in their way, the church is evil and there always is a commander who is like insane and needs a psychiatrist right now bla bla). Despite all of those flaws (and I admit that I'm really judging this series a little hard) ""Attack on Titan"" looks really good and has a imo catching opening music which features the opening line in my own language (german) ... sadly Japanese are no pronouncing experts and so I never got it until I looked it up on the internet ;-P",13,39,"Jul 5, 2014"

I saw the first season a couple of years ago, then it sort of disappeared for awhile before I finally got to watch season 2 just now on Netflix (thank you, Netflix).

And season 2 was just as good as season 1, full of mysteries, twists, sub plots and of course action. The horror aspect of the series also works very well, a bunch of zombie giants going around and dealing death to humans in gruesome ways.

Some of the subplots are a bit too melodramatic, though, and some doesn't seem to make too much sense, but overall, it just somehow works as a very entertaining anime series.

10,Attack on GOAT,"We're about a week away from S4 part 2 and I haven't stopped thinking about this show since I watched it a few months ago. It is truly one of the best the genre has to offer.

The pacing is some of the best I've seen. There's no filler and you'll never have to go long without a new story beat to get the plot moving. Plot twists are frequent but not cheap. There's no a-ha moments at the end of an episode just to make you watch another 24 minutes of monologue. Twists are meaningful and well-developed. You'll appreciate the story even more a second time through when you recognize all the little hints that build up to those reveals.

Admittedly, the story does take a while to pick up. Characters don't develop much depth in the first season and likewise the themes addressed early on are fairly elementary. AOT's idea of world-building in the first two seasons is to present a lot of questions and give very few answers. However, the pay-off when these questions are finally answered in seasons 3 and 4 can not be understated. Every single scene matters and anything that is mentioned is a plot point later on in the show, even if it takes a while to get there. The show is known for having some of, if not the best foreshadowing in the medium. You need to rewatch the show at least one other time to appreciate all the nuances in characters' body language or side comments in particular situations.

The action/animation is a strong point throughout the entire series. Even still shots of the landscape are a joy to stop and look at. The motion animation for ODM gear scenes in seasons 1-3 are particularly captivating to me. Most well-animated fights in other anime are just a wide shot of the battle field with flashes of bright colors and cubes bursting out of the ground, but fights in AOT transition between so many different angles and shots that you can't miss a single frame of action. In seasons 3 and 4 the large scale battles are particularly interesting because of the amount of strategy involved. Both sides of the conflict have entirely unique advantages and disadvantages and it's wonderful to see how both sides play their cards during these drawn out fights.

Once the show settles into its own it's impossible to put down. The fights are brilliant, the themes are incredibly nuanced, the characters are well developed, and the plot will always keep you on toes.

For those who care, the show is great subbed or dubbed. I watched it my first time dubbed because I didn't like reading during fight scenes, but on my second go through I watched it subbed. Both are incredibly well done, don't both trying to debate which is better. Watch it however you prefer.

Talk about any criteria in rating shows, character development, plot, story, cast, vfx(amine style here), production, final output,etc. ATTACK ON TITAN is the best!!!! In only 3 seasons it has accomplished so much, its story is compelling and no doubt the best thing in this show. But the another thing is moments. This show has so many mind blowing moments which will leave you in sense of joy of being able to watch this anime. Please watch it now and enjoy loving this show.",50,12,"Jun 27, 2020"
10,I don't even like Anime..,"My only experience with Anime prior to this is Pokémon. I used to be one of those characters who thought Anime was for kids only, until I came across this one.. Would definetely not recommend this one to children knowing it's capable of giving grown men nightmares. After watching the first episode I was gripped. I just finished watching the second season and I hear the third one is even better! The intensity, the characters, the story and the visual style is really appealing! There is not a single dull moment here. Every episode brings something to the table and it gets better and better with each passing episode.

You don't have to be into Anime to appreciate this masterpiece! It stands well on it's own regardless of genre. Highly recommend you give this a chance if you haven't already!",37,8,"Nov 5, 2020"

The Ending was rushed but it was beautifully executed in the anime. 9/10 Animation, 10/10 story, 10/10 characters, 10/10 emotions, 10/10 background music.

5,Great setting but eventually undermined by poor execution of story and underused characters.,"This show had great potential but bad writing eventually brings it down.

Character development is poor with the exception of the main three. The biggest positive is the soundtrack which is easily one of the best. The show also tends to drag some episodes for far too long but it could easily have told the same story in a shorter amount of time. Hopefully season 2 will explain some of the origin story since it is all smoke and mirrors as of now.

It is a wasted opportunity due to poor execution and story decisions and at best an average show",22,106,"Oct 30, 2014"

I can understand why people thinks Aot is ""overrated"" and these kind of things but what else to add. That's what Isayama wanted. People still uses to think Aot is just humans vs titans but they don't know that Aot is like two different series and is probably one of the top 5 pieces of fiction with the most complexity.

10,"If the imdb website ranked the top 250 series based on the average scores of the episodes, Attack on Titan would rank 1.

I say with all certainty that Attack on Titan is the best animated series in history, and also in competition with non-animated series, if we want to rank it, it is definitely among the top 5 in history. This series is one of those series that has deep themes and concepts for the audience. For example: sacrifice, patriotism, war, peace, etc., which are rarely seen in a series. From the very first episode, it offers you a stormy and violent start. Personally, when I saw the first episode, my body trembled and I realized right then that this series is a masterpiece. Among other features of this series that I can mention, the soundtrack is unique and goes with the series. You just need to watch season 4 to understand its military and political style. The direction is also at a very high level.

The storyboards are amazing, the ending of most of the episodes ends in a way that makes your body shiver. As I mentioned in the beginning, if the ranking of the site was based on the average score of the parts, it would be ranked 1, and the total score of the parts would be 9.07.

3,Confusing with lots of babbling,"I used to enjoy anime same as how I used to enjoy games but the follow the herd social media hype mentality ruined those things for a lot of people who enjoyed what they enjoyed or hated what they hated for their own reasons and opinions.

It's hard to know what's good or criticize anything that is popular based on heard mentality. This is a mediocre anime but it has almost a 10 rating.

Why? Nothing bout this anime is a 10. Not even Neon Genesis or Dragonballz or bleach is a 10 and those are legendarily good anime. So how is it that this mediocre anime got so much hype?

Because people are afraid to dislike it because people more popular than then liked it so it grew and grew steadily avoiding the criticism it deserved.

But I don't mind dating the truth. This anime is bad. It has good animation but it's bad. The characters are as generic as you can get. Every last one of them is forgettable. I've seen all seasons can't even tell you who was memorable because I forgot most of them. They're the same character personalities you see in every anime. If you've seen Bleach which this anime seems to steal a lot of its ideas from than you probably dislike this anime as much as I do for the same reasons.

The plot is all over the place. Babbling about this and that and all the characters have long German names. I had enough of that in full metal alchemist (another over hyped anime). They can really talk on this series and boy do they talk. Yap Yap yap yap yap. I don't know what they're talking about it's just gibberish and nonsense.

And the story jumps around a lot so be prepared to be forever confused. Season 4 is the worst. They just jump around in time to the point you have no idea what's going on at all. Are the future? The past? Present day? One characters dead then She's alive? It's a headache to follow.

This is on my top 10 of worst anime's I've watched. ""The von stauker honz snitzel titan has to eat the doberglobersteinbergzzhemer titan that the becklesteimer von germanberger family owns."" That's how they talk on this show. It's 40+ episodes a season of that ""You devils blah blah blah"" just make this show end. This is not a 9 worthy show. Seriously it's a 5 at best. It has Zero likes me characters, a plot that makes no sense what so ever, predictable story line and it suffers from ""we almost had him"" syndrome.

This animie will make you truly ignore all review ratings from now and forever on. You can't hide how bad this is. This has good animie gore and so did Tokyo ghoul and both those animie suck.",14,60,"Mar 12, 2023"
10,Aot the best,"This show holds a special place in my heart as one of my all-time favorites. While nostalgia may contribute to my love for it, I genuinely believe that this series is one of the most brilliantly crafted stories of all time. The journey of the show, from its humble beginnings to its breathtaking conclusion, explores the depths of human instinct, strategy, and personal growth in a truly magnificent way. Some may criticize the stark contrast between the initial setting and the final stages of the story, but I believe that this stark contrast is what makes Attack on Titan truly beautiful. Evolution. The symbolism and hidden meanings that unfold throughout the narrative are a testament to the meticulous storytelling.

The writing in the beginning of the series is exceptional, allowing viewers to immerse themselves in the same mindset as the characters within the walls. We embark on a journey of discovery alongside the protagonists, experiencing their joys and sorrows. This sense of shared experience makes the storytelling all the more powerful and captivating. While the animation in the first season may not be as extensive as some would prefer, it does not hinder the profound story it aims to convey. However, as the series gained popularity, the animation quality dramatically improves, offering visually stunning and dynamic scenes that leave a lasting impression. It's important to note this evolution so that potential viewers aren't discouraged by the animation in the first season alone. While in the first season, dialogue scenes may lack in animation, the action sequences are a visual spectacle, filled with impressive animation and choreography.",13,1,"Mar 22, 2024"

It has no dull or useless moments, the animation is PERFECT and still shots enhance the value by giving you a pause in time while something important is happening or you are required to think. The story never slows - the training episodes are perfect character development and give us a much more intimate feeling of the cadets , thier characters and how they fight.

Most of all the story is gripping, scary and is great cause for reflection. I found myself thinking if a world where humans are exterminated like this might actually be a better place - take a look outside the walls were the nature is so pristine because humans cannot go there!

10,The greatest story ever told! Thank you,"I read over 75 Manga and watched more than 100 Tv Series and Anime, but this is the best thing we will watch on a screen for a long time.

I saw that some kids who didn't get the message complained about the ending!

This is hisayama story and if he hadn't wanted to end it this way we probably wouldn't even have had Attack on Titan. Just think twice before writing a comment.

He exterminated 80% of the world's population knowing that the only thing almost sure was the safety of his friends. And I think the only reason he did it is that he was already aware that war and violence are inevitable and interminable. As a martyr, Eren proved to be the great selfish child he has been from the beginning of history; deciding to guarantee peace to his friends, rather than seeking it for humanity.

This is why I can't find Armin's sentence on the out-of-character genocide: at that moment, he already knows that everything is inevitable, there is no reason to attack Eren; because Armin, up to that moment, was the planner, the one who tries to shape the future thanks to his mind... but what can a planner do, if the future is written? He can only accept it and decide to thank Eren for all the pain he has taken on, that doesn't mean he approves of his actions or that he would do the same, just that there is no reason to discuss it.

It is certainly a bit hasty ending, like the whole final part of the manga, but it is the bitter ending that was expected: although the giants no longer exist, everything is as before, because not giants, but HUMANS are the real problem. The only hope he leaves us is that Armin, who unlike Eren has always leaned on dialogue, will be able to resolve the tensions. This shows to us the importance of diplomacy, this is our ""lovely"" real world.

As an expert who studied International Relations at university, this is a Masterpiece that will always be remembered!",20,3,"Apr 10, 2021"

No other movie/tv show/anime has this lvl of storytelling. Some people consider it boring for the first 3 seasons. But mark my words. If you find it boring untill S3 keep going. When S3 part 2 kicks in you will reward yourself with the greatest story ever told!

10,The best series of all time!!,"""Attack on Titan"" is more than just an anime. The main plot of the series presents a relentless battle of humanity for survival against the Titans. However, as the series goes on, it reveals much more about the human psyche and societal structures, through its detailed storytelling and character development.

What lies beyond the walls ? What is the secret of the basement ? Why some humans have capability of transforming themselves into Titans ? What is the origin of Titans ? Why there are Titans in the walls ? WHO IS THE REAL ENEMY OF HUMANITY??? . These are some question which will keep you constantly curious. Each revelation leads to even more intriguing mysteries.

The most compelling aspects of AoT is its shifting portrayal of the enemy. Initially, the Titans are the clear antagonists. However, as the story progresses, it becomes evident that the true enemy may lie within humanity itself. The series questions who the real monsters are? The mindless Titans or the humans driven by fear, hatred, and a thirst for power.

AoT removes the conventional perspective of a hero and villain, where the hero triumphs over the villain leading to a happy ending. Instead, it presents complex characters with different motivations, blurring the lines between good and evil.

Even after finishing the series, it continues to offer new insights with each rewatch. Subtle foreshadowing, and new interpretation makes it even more appreciable.",8,0,"Jul 28, 2024"
9,"Wow, this was...complex but highly enjoyable","I was hooked on the story right away and would say it was something I hadn't seen before which is rare these days. The series is short each of the regular episodes are less than 20 mins with a recap, long intro and long credits the episodes whip by.

There are many twists and turns throughout the show but overall things felt consistent, no weird rush to the end. It has a satisfying ending as in a proper ending something a lot of series don't seem to get.

I don't think i will ever rewatch this series as it was too gut wrenching, I was really into all the characters so it felt like I was sharing their fate so to speak. I can see why some might not like the ending but it has nothing to do with quality or story but more hope for a bright shiny future.

I will give a warning this is pretty graphic, not something that bothers me usually in animation but it was more the situation in the last two episodes not for the faint of heart (kids getting killed in pretty grusome ways). Having said that I can't recommend this one enough. I am not big on anime and no one in my circle would expect me to recommend it to them but i will be this time.",8,0,"May 6, 2024"
10,Attack on Titan: Irreplaceable,"I've never written a review for a show before. But this show changed that for me. I know that this review may never be seen by people but i'm still gonna write this. Attack on Titan was recommended to me many times. I first tried it in middle school and wasn't fond of it and didn't go back to it until the middle of my sophomore year in high school. Now that i'm older and more developed it is easier for me to be patient with shows. Starting AOT for the second time was the best choice I ever made. If I could ever rewatch a show blind again it would be this show. There is no show that has ever made me feel like I can't express how good it is. I watched seasons 1-3 in a couple weeks and took a break before season 4. When I started season 4 I couldn't stop. I finished it in a week (because of school). This was the only time i've ever sacrificed my own sleep to watch a show. I watched the second half of season 4 in one night, I wasn't tired, I was hooked. Even before I watched season 4 I thought AOT was incredible. But this season changed it. Most people think season 3 is the best, I also thought that, until I finished season 4. The last 2 episodes of that season are some of the great pieces of cinema ever. The day after I finished the show, I was quiet. There was no show that ever made me feel like this. I couldn't explain the feelings I had, it was a mix of happiness, sadness, and another feeling I couldn't quite place. Before watching, I knew people loved this show. Incredible reviews everywhere. I've never really been a person to hop on trends, but this show deserves the respect it gets. After I finished it, it just feels like most shows are bland and tasteless in a way. Don't get me wrong, there are still shows I love to watch, but it just feels like there's something missing from them AOT had but I can't place it. If you read this through fully, thank you, and if your wondering if you should watch it. Yes. Yes. Yes. This is the greatest show i've ever watched, not anime, show. But that's all I can really say. No show has given me the feeling that this show gave me after completion, and I don't think there will be another that will. And for that i'm grateful.

Everyone has their story that they want to finish. The best thing about aot is that it never gets boring, there are so many plots going around and so many questions that need to be answered. This show went on for 10 years and it became one of the most watched Anime of all time that tells u how good it is. So watch it and recommend it to others. Its one of the goated series ever.

7,Season 4 ruined it!,"I know this review isnt going to get many likes, but this is how I feel

The number of stars is for the whole series - 10 stars for each of series 1..3 and 1 star for series 4.

I loved seasons 1 - 3 and was looking forward to season 4 to wrap up everything... First couple of episodes were great, then what happened?

Characters are drawn differently - so much so I didnt even recognise them! This is what I dislike the most.

Personalities have changed, now they are brooding, narcissistic and not likeable. Erin completely unlikable.

Story is hard to follow and flashes forward, flashes back, flashes all around.

And its boring

After getting to ep 13 or thereabouts, I dont think I can bring myself to finish watching them, because every episode is getting worse.",7,25,"Nov 11, 2023"
2,Epically Meh,"If you're into militaresque anime then this may appeal, that is if you can get past all the film noir soliloquies of course.

Now for the review: The story is first up. To describe it as forced would be kind. The drama is 'heightened' by deaths of characters and not much else. This would be a good tactic if the viewer is drawn into their stories. However, excessive fatalism, over-hyped fear by characters, what can only be deliberate blindness to the obvious by characters and there's not much to keep the viewer on board. The drip feed of the story is also maddeningly slow - all the action in an episode could be condensed down to half the time if the repetitive action sequences weren't drawn out.

Characters are next. Eren Yeager our protagonist (Pronounced Jaeger like the hunter - Chekhov's gun anyone?) Switches from whiny kid, moron, fatalistic moron, universal soldier wanna-be, and drill sergeant harda*se wanna-be. The rest seem to be either titan chow or natural born killers. You can tell who's who by how much you're pushed to like them. Hate them, they'll see the who series through. Love them, they'll die - usually by being eaten.

Animation. This is actually good, for the most part. Some scenes are over worked but mostly well done. If only they didn't fill up so much of each episode with recaps and intros and end credits.

All in all, AoT is not bad has massive problems that can't be brushed over by manipulative drama.",42,248,"May 23, 2018"

The story is very well written and thus has a lot of details that you can pick up if you watch carefully. 10/10 The voice actors/actresses have done an excellent job of conveying their emotions thorough only their voice and therefore I recommend watching it in Japanese and not Dub.10/10 The animation team is just exceptional & If you don't believe me just watch it . 10/10 The music and soundtracks of the shows is I think its Very good & I'm not talking about the opening and ending songs, I'm talking about the music without lyrics thorough out the episodes. 9/10 Overall I believe even if you don't like anime in particular, you don't want to miss this because it just might be the best anime in this generation",8,0,"Jul 15, 2019"

9,Wild ride,"It's easy to take something for granted given how popular it is. With so many people singing praise you just kind of accept things as a given. This undersells a lot of qualities one might otherwise take notice of, transforming the exceptional into simply decent. I even started falling into the camp that considered if AoT was possibly overrated.

Turns out, this show is just as advertised. It's spectacular. The striking art style, intense action sequences, novelty of freaky-looking giants that eat people and mystery plus betrayal throughout. There's an entire world they built here that complements and mixes all of that seamlessly, with phenomenal characters to match. Just people absolutely full of personality. Completely realized and shown in such a natural way. I can recall everyone's name and know exactly the kind of person they are. Being able to do this in any story is impressive, and that much more so when you realize it's just one part of the entire package.

I dislike writing praise while avoiding spoilers. Everything put down ends up sounding massively generic, full of buzzword phrases and descriptions that don't feel like they mean anything. So I'll keep it short. This show is thrilling, sad, terrifying, and it'll make you laugh. You will grow attached to the characters. They are, for the most part, wholly unique. The plot is a little convoluted but impressive given the scale it encompasses, with bizarre and inspired mechanics that oddly enough sounds like it should make sense. Emotions conveyed are also perfect. The gritty desperation, abject horror, goofball camaraderie and awkward displays of affection-- you will feel all of that.

The first season, despite being simple and generic among anime, has this mysterious layer under its surface that grips onto the watcher and doesn't let go. The second season then takes everything the viewer thought they knew about the series, and flips it on its head. By this point, the viewer has realised that they aren't just watching a generic dark shonen. No, they are watching something that extends far deeper. Then in the season three, everything that the viewer didn't know or understand from the previous seasons gets answered clearly and flawlessly. By this point the viewer thinks they know everything and that the final season will just use what was mentioned or established, right? WRONG!

6,Attack on Titan - An Epic Saga That Lost Its Way (2013-2023),"I remember when ""Attack on Titan"" burst onto the anime scene back in 2013. It was like a breath of fresh air in a genre often cluttered with high school settings and slice-of-life stories. The premise was intriguing: humanity on the brink of extinction, surrounded by colossal humanoid creatures known as Titans. As a longtime anime fan, I was excited to see where this series would take us.

The first season of ""Attack on Titan"" gripped me from the start. The grim atmosphere, the towering Titans, and the sense of hopelessness that shrouded the characters made for an intense and immersive experience. Eren Yeager, Mikasa Ackerman, and Armin Arlert were well-developed protagonists, and their journey to uncover the truth about the Titans was a compelling narrative.

The animation quality by Wit Studio was outstanding, especially during the jaw-dropping action sequences where the omni-directional mobility gear was used to fight Titans. The fluidity of movement and the sheer scale of the battles were a visual treat for any anime enthusiast.

However, as the series progressed, I couldn't help but notice some cracks in the armor. The pacing became erratic, with episodes of slow exposition followed by frenetic action. New characters were introduced at a rapid pace, making it difficult to form strong connections with them. The mysteries surrounding the Titans and the world they inhabited grew increasingly convoluted, leaving me with more questions than answers.

Another issue that emerged was the tonal shift in the story. The initial sense of dread and urgency gave way to political intrigue and philosophical debates. While these elements can enhance a story, they felt forced at times, causing the narrative to lose its focus.

The decision to split the final season into two parts further disrupted the flow of the story. It left viewers hanging with numerous unresolved plotlines, creating a sense of frustration rather than anticipation.

Character development suffered as well. Eren, once a relatable protagonist driven by a desire for vengeance, underwent a transformation that made him less empathetic. The moral complexities that were initially explored were overshadowed by an increasingly black-and-white worldview.

The animation quality, too, saw a decline, particularly in the final season. While some episodes still delivered stunning visuals, others were marred by inconsistent art and animation.

In conclusion, ""Attack on Titan"" began as a promising and groundbreaking series that challenged the conventions of anime. Its first season was a thrilling ride, but as the years passed, it lost its way. The complex narrative, once a strength, became convoluted, and the tonal shifts left me feeling disconnected from the characters and their struggles.

While I appreciate the ambition and creativity that went into ""Attack on Titan,"" I can't help but feel that it didn't fulfill its early promise. I rate it 6/10 because, despite its flaws, it still managed to captivate me at times and deliver memorable moments, but the inconsistency and lack of a satisfying conclusion left me somewhat disappointed.",6,22,"Sep 15, 2023"

Through the span of two weeks I went through an emotional rollercoaster of the best writing I've ever witnessed, I haven't experienced this much emotion watching a show in years, every character is so beautifully written it makes me want to cry just thinking about it (and I did cry many times watching it). I never really understood people saying that a show was something you needed to watch before you died, but I do now. After I finished aot I spent a good few days just thinking about it practically unable to do anything else, I urge absolutely everyone to watch it at least once in their life.",8,0,"Aug 11, 2024"

There are anime that are very good, there are anime that are absolutely amazing. Attack on titan is beyond all that. It's at the top and nothing can come close to it.

If I could erase my memory and watch it all over again I'd do it, 10 times, 100 times, 1000 times.

10,Arguably one of the best TV shows ever,"Much has been said about this show already and it's merit as an anime show. However, while anime is usually constructed as periodic pure entertainment this show trancends not only that format in terms of writing but most regular tv shows as well. The way the whole mystery is constructed impeccably from start to finish, always answering one question while raising two new ones is testament to true genius. Many have attempted it (""Lost"", few have really achieved it, leaving the viewer dissatisfied.

But the greatest achievement of his series is probably to draw a horror and fantasy crowd in and subvert all expections with a theme about the human tragedy of war and the neverending circle of violence. Yes, at its heart ""Attack on Titan"" (which should really be called ""The Attack Titan"" since that other translation makes little sense) is about human nature and suffering and how there's really no escape in this life. The only way is forward, to go with the flow and make the best of every situation. Right and wrong are merely a matter of perspective and several shifts of perspective are masterfully executed throughout the series.

The basic premise of mindless giants that eat people sounds ho hum on paper but watching it gives a much different feeling. As an audience we don't know a whole lot more than the characters so the emotional impact of twists and turns mirrors the character development. And believe me, there are twists and turns you probably won't expect. No one is safe in this world and it is a brutal world. The requisite young pair of kids is there as the focal point for the series and there are other typical anime trappings I've noticed, based on my limited exposure to the genre, but you will immediately forget about those if they bother you because the story is so darn riveting. Violent. Bloody without being gratuitous in the gore department, the horror comes from unpredictability and the feeling we are seeing what it is like to be ants in a human world. Highly recommended for adults. Don't dare expose this to sensitive children, it will absolutely freak them out in a bad way. As far as I can tell this series also is staying very close to the Manga.

The show has an amazingly good pace, with a blend of gut wrenching tense action scenes and heartfelt character moments. The characters in this show are so unique and distinct, every character feels real and three dimensional, despite their occasional silly anime style banter (which is entertaining in its own right). The soundtrack is also amongst the best any television show has produced, and it expresses the tones of the show and makes every scene even better. 'Vogel im Kafig' is a musical masterpiece, and i recommend you give it a listen even if you haven't seen the show.

10,Masterpiece,"As a fan of the anime, I recently had the pleasure of watching Attack on Titan, and I must say, it's one of the most thrilling and captivating shows I've seen in a long time. From its stunning animation to its engaging storyline, Attack on Titan has truly raised the bar for anime as a medium.

One of the most impressive aspects of the show is its world-building. The post-apocalyptic world that the characters inhabit is richly detailed and feels fully realized, with every location and culture having its own unique identity. The world is also filled with a sense of dread and danger, thanks to the constant threat of the Titans, which keeps the tension high throughout the show.

The characters themselves are equally impressive. Each member of the main cast is well-developed, with their own distinct personalities, motivations, and flaws. The relationships between them are complex and nuanced, and watching them grow and evolve over the course of the series is a joy.

Of course, none of this would matter if the action wasn't up to snuff, but thankfully, Attack on Titan delivers on this front as well. The battles against the Titans are intense and thrilling, with the animation and sound design working in perfect tandem to create a sense of chaos and danger.

Overall, I would highly recommend Attack on Titan to anyone looking for an exciting, well-crafted anime series. While it may not be for everyone, those who are willing to dive into its dark and brutal world will be rewarded with an unforgettable experience.

7,A complete outsider review of Attack on Titan,"Like many I only recently broke into the whole anime scene shortly after hearing the buzz around Attack on Titan. This is the very first anime series I've experienced so I judged it with the standards I would hold for any other none-anime TV series or movie.

The series has a fantastic start. The first 5 or 6 episodes completely exceeded my expectations - The music was great, the pacing, writing and directing was all near perfect, and the animation was well done. There were moments in this series that made me so shocked and amazed that I thought I was watching Game Of Thrones again. It also doesn't shy away from gore or sad themes, which is a plus. The actual concept of the story is extremely well realised, so I applaud the original manga for that.

Now, for the downsides. I am going to write more about this since everyone seems to be avoiding it. I'm not sure who said this anime has ""excellent characters"" but this is not right. The characters are VERY average. The main characters have SOME development, but generally remain the same throughout. The minor characters all seem to be 2D cutouts of your average teen drama with some exceptions. Character development, for the most part, seems to be exclusively limited to characters dropping on their knees, crying and doing an extensive monologue of past events, or what is to come. It may have worked well if it was used occasionally, but this technique is used multiple times every episode. There are some episodes which really seem to be fillers - one episode seemed to reuse a little too much footage from previous episodes, and another episode seemed to be jam-packed with voiced over none animated scenes. I felt like the last half of the series started dropping in and out of quality. You'll often find yourself - in later episodes - sitting through 13 minutes of stupid monologue only to get to the fully animated treats.

In conclusion, this is well worth watching. Plenty of ""WTF"" moments, emotional scenes and action in a well realised world. If you can look past the flaws I mentioned, you'll find a truly special experience.",11,53,"Jul 16, 2013"

10,Greatest story in any anime and possibly all media,"What makes this series stand out from the rest and become herald as potentially the greatest series ever is the amount of depth and substance that was implemented in all faucets of this series starting with its narrative as it's driving point. This series makes use of the idea that everything presented in a story must apply to the progression of the story and elevates this expectation by managing to present a narrative with subtext, multiple interpretations, and actual progression being presented simultaneously.",12,1,"Nov 20, 2021"
10,A Masterful story with great level of details.,"I've seen many big shows and movies in my life , Game of thrones, breaking bad, true detective, chernobyl etc and believe me this show is as good as those I just mentioned. The writer of this show truly cares about the details as I never seen any show in my life with such care of details. I know animes are hard to get into (atleast for me) but once you give this show a fair try believe you will love it !. The intensity, the resolve , the storyline, the complexity of human society, the human nature of repeating blunders, this show shows all these things and the list not ends here it has great soundtrack, great environment setting and a unparallel storytelling. This show deserves a spot among the all time greatest shows.",12,1,"Jun 8, 2024"

4,I don't understand the hype.,"Before I started watching I got mixed opinions about this show from several different people. I finally decided to watch it, and I have to say that this show, to me, is more boring than exciting. The constant whining from Eren and Armin have, on several occasions, almost made me abandon the show. The dialog in the show is WAY overdone. The entire first season should have been told in two episodes at the most. I use the FF button quite frequently. It's gotten to the point that I don't care about any big surprises coming up. The writers have watched way too many M. Night Shyamalan movies. There doesn't have to always have a strange twist with every reveal. The only reason I gave it a 4 is because the animation is pretty good, and the only character that I like in the show Mikasa, is a real badass that they show way too little of, again in my opinion. I've almost made it through the first season, and I finish things I start, so hopefully my rating changes for the better in the future.",14,72,"Mar 17, 2022"
10,This anime get's to much hate,"I see a lot of people hating on Aot has it got more popular. I'm not surprised since any anime that starts to get popular get's hate for no reason. Aot should not be one of them in any way. The story is god tier, character devlopment, amazing plot twist, always keeps me on the edge of my seat because anybody can die, amazing pacing. Also it actually has world building but people never talk about it for some reason. Like when they overthrew the government that's world building or when they found out other human exist outside the walls. That's world building. This anime has no flaws. The only one I can think of is maybe you don't like the characters",12,1,"Jun 20, 2020"
10,From Me to You,"Being in the medical field kept my mind busy and my lifestyle a routine. One day, year 2014, I stumbled upon this anime as I goggled my way through the internet. I randomly asked my brother about it out of curiosity since he was younger than me and obviously had the luxury of time to see such things (he's a weeb so to speak) and he told me he couldn't get into it because he was busy with school (as if that's true). Anyway, I couldn't take my eyes off on the image I saw on Google about a huge man with no skin and tall thick walls infront of it. There was alot of rave going on alright. It has collected numerous reviews and stars beside it's title.

At first I was hesitant. I didn't like post apocalyptic themed shows. The setting looked medieval which was not something I enjoy as a theme in general BUT anyways what the heck, I gave it a go. One peaceful night, the very day I was off work, no patients, no managers, just me myself and I, I decided to turn the TV on and stream Attack on Titan.

I cried. I was bawling my eyes out the first episode. I have never felt immense fear, hopelessness, despair and darkness in an episode let alone in an anime. Sure I've seen tons when I was a kid but never this intense. It was gut wrenching and since then I couldn't stop. I had to finish 2 seasons in a span of 24 hours. Not even 24. I kept going until there was no more. That is how good this show is for me.

The plot, the animation, the soundtrack, the voice acting. If anime had OSCARS, this is it. Hands down, this deserves it. It's roller coaster ride of emotions. And it's not even about romance, friendship etc. all of that, its for single purpose and if you want to know what that is, you need to see this now.",19,3,"Jun 4, 2019"

The soundtrack was perfect and couldn't have been any better.

The protagonist was interesting and felt unique The only problem that this show has is that the ending could have been so much better and I felt like some characters got way too much screen time for the show's sake.

But otherwise this show is extremely special to me and I consider calling this the greatest show I ever watched.",15,2,"Mar 4, 2024"
10,"Attack on Titan is a unique and top-tier addition to the anime genre, an absolute must-see","I recently completed watching season 4 of ""Attack on Titan"" (2013) after it was highly recommended by Finnigan Sommers. Finnigan sent me an ""Attack on Titan"" t-shirt for my birthday one year and insisted that I watch it, so my daughter and I did, and it's nothing short of amazing.

The storyline unfolds in a futuristic society where the last survivors reside within enormous walled cities to keep the man-eating Titans at bay, for the most part. However, these Titans keep breaching the walls and inching closer to the central city where the leaders of humanity reside. Questions arise: Why do the Titans exist? What role did the government play in their creation? Can anyone stop them?

Created by Hajime Isayama, this series boasts a brilliant storyline with profound depth. The animation is intense, graphic, and perpetually instills a sense of fear and hopelessness in every scene and situation. Even when characters experience moments of happiness or believe they have a path forward, I couldn't help but think, ""Why, when we know how this will turn out."" The Titans are portrayed as ruthless and well-crafted antagonists. The exploration of the Titans' origins is a smart and intricately developed subplot that keeps your mind racing with possibilities. I thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of this series. My only minor complaint would be that some of the political subplots and character development can drag, but it's challenging to criticize ""too much talking"" while also acknowledging the series' remarkable depth.

In conclusion, Attack on Titan is a unique and top-tier addition to the anime genre, an absolute must-see. Thank you, Finn, for the recommendation. I miss you, buddy. I would give this a 9.5/10 rating and strongly recommend it.",15,2,"Sep 29, 2023"

5,Nothing Special and Boring,"First let me begin with the few good things: the concept (not the story) is good the animation is great and first opening song is outstanding.

This anime had a good start but it rapidly turned dull. I don't get the hype and high ratings.

The most boring part of this anime are the characters. All they do is talking, whining, weeping. Every single encounter turns to an endless depressing whirlpool of a should've, could've, would've but we didn't.

Not to mention the cringey pep-talks.

Basically too much talking very little action.

10,One of my favorite anime. does little wrong.,"This anime is one of the best ever made. The animation in the first season is amazing, and it was made nearly a decade ago as of this writing! The plot twists are amazing. I unfortunately got a few spoilers about events and other things about the show. But even when I saw these events happen, they still had twists and turns that I didn't coming. The third season and season 4 part one are possibly the best of the entire show. I get the complaint's about season four part two. It is pretty slow in the last half of the season but in all fairness with the events going on, the production studio couldn't have days or weeks go by.

10,"The Sopranos, The Wire, Six Feet Under and Breaking Bad from the anime. It's all a combination of the best HBO shows","I started watching HBO's Barry, which was excellent by the way, at the same time as this masterpiece.

I'm not a regular fan of anime, I've seen some really good ones, but Attack on Titan is on a whole different level of awesome writing alongside evangelion, lain, monster, and cowboy bebbop.

The way the story unfolds is so well written and engaging that it had me hooked from the first season, where the plot seemed to be a very basic revenge story between humans trapped living inside mysterious walls and their nemesis, humanoid titans who it appears to exist for the sole purpose of eating live humans.

It's hard to do a detailed review without giving up spoilers, I've shared the premises, but Attack on Titan is much more than that... From the parallels with the real world through themes like war, greed, complacency, they inherit the curiosity for exploration until they reach the gray characters and their respective development,

Ambiguity is a concept always present in our lives, and this show represents it as very few do, this associated with the brilliant evolution of the characters throughout the 4 seasons is remarkable, you can empathize with someone who did things more horrible and that shows how brilliant the creator is.

On top of all of the above, you'll be faced with many mind-blowing twists and unexpected dark turns in the story, with some of the best animation work I've ever seen on screen, especially the most recent episodes, considering this started almost 10 years ago. !

Excellent soundtrack, I get the creeps a lot of the fight scenes and of course it goes without saying that the fights themselves are brilliant, harrowing and make you feel really excited with all the elements of the action combined, really unique. TV show.

I look forward to the final part next year. I don't know if it will end badly, but so far it's a flawless masterpiece and I don't say that lightly.

Picks up a few days after where we left off last season and focuses more on the political drama and dilemmas within the walls. This season gets right to the point and introduces a new villain named Kenny who turns out to be somehow related to Levi. There are many parts trying to get Eren and Historia. For what reason? It is yet to be revealed. The mystery we all fell in love with is still there and there are even more questions, but don't let that distract you from the fact that this season, while only lasting a few episodes, already has some major reveals. The pacing is incredible and I wasn't bored for a moment while watching. Things get more interesting when Erwin reveals how he plans to overthrow the government without using force. This season has a very refreshing and different plot compared to the previous ones, as we can see from the lack of titans and the focus on the issues within the walls rather than beyond. However, it is still just as interesting, if not more so, than before. There's world building, mystery, backstabbing, and some great questions answered with hopefully more to come.

Attack on Titan is the king of world and story building. With ultra-realistic consequences that are missing from many animations, Attack on Titan stands out because it has an incredibly dark world with real risks. The horror and adrenaline aspects when there is an action scene are stellar. The characters, action, and music can all have episodes, but they don't have to because the show is already so good. The characters have depth and feel like real people, they die constantly and never feel 100% safe. The action is some of the best action in any show. The mysterious aspects make even moments that may seem bland feel that much more impactful. This is perhaps one of the best stories ever written. The music makes this epic world feel vast and important, while also sounding phenomenal.",18,3,"May 30, 2022"

7,An anime for adult,"Attack on Titan is an intricately crafted anime with a well-developed world setting. The anime traces back to the Titans' birth and the upcoming wars with igniting conflicts, rivalries, and hatred among different races, nations, and human beings. Each nation possesses a unique worldview, social structure, and physical environment to safeguard themselves. The hometown of the protagonist Eren is a classic example, with three daunting walls and the exhilarating three military branches to maintain the country. With the world setting, numerous main and supporting characters embark on difficult journeys, seek the meaning of life and exploring their true selves.

Despite the abundance of characters, almost every major role is depicted with profound depth and uniqueness. Even those who are not the main characters possess astonishing character development. The richness and subtlety of these characters do make the anime quite lengthy, but they also make the fictional world real.

The inter-human warfare is the main setting, but the anime delves into deeper themes, such as human vulnerability, fear, selfishness, and growth. Some of the questions that I particularly appreciate are: Why do humans keep repeating a history of war? Is killing justified for the sake of loved ones? How can world peace be achieved? What is the root cause of the world's lack of harmony? As individuals, what should we care about? Do all individuals harbor fears and end up closing themselves within walls, brainwashing themselves to distort the outside world beyond those walls?

It is a fantastic anime that excels in world-building, character development, thematic reflections, and narrative storytelling. However, being an epic-length animation, it is destined not to be flawless. The lengthy and dragging plotlines, abrupt shifts in the protagonist's motivations, imperfect back-and-forth timeline transitions, overly deliberate facial expressions, monotonously gloomy art style, overwhelmingly crafted sense of fear, all of these could lead to some discomfort during the viewing process.",2,5,"Jul 30, 2023"

10,Greatness,"Some of the moments in this feel like the best thing I've ever seen. It is a new level of epic fiction. It feels like it accomplishes what Game of Thrones was trying to do. The plot is complex and philosophical and really goes into a real deep meditation on the nature of war. All anime has the benefit of the internal monologue, which lets you hear a characters thoughts that gives the form an ability to portray poetry and philosophy like no other visual medium. The plot twists are ingenious.

The younger generations in the west are generally more open to anime, and I'm hoping in the next decade there will be some real serious efforts in Hollywood to bring things like this series, Akira and Cowboy Bebop to the west and do them justice. It's frustrating that because of some preconceived notions of what anime is, older generations and the mass culture may miss out on something that to me surpasses other epic fiction like Game of Thrones, Star Wars, even Lord of the Rings, in depth and intensity and intelligence. This is the greatest piece of epic fiction of this generation.",11,1,"Apr 1, 2021"
10,Arguably the best show I've ever watched in my life,"The level of care that went into this show left me in complete shock. Once I finished season three, it was all I could think about for days. The music, transcending and well placed with each scene to deliver powerful emotions. The plot/story, full of unexpected events and the pacing is amazing. I never once found myself bored. Every single episode delivered a punch. Perhaps what I found the most compelling part of the show is how truly real the characters felt. Their dialogue, their actions felt so human. It didn't feel like, ""oh this is just a show."" Not by a long shot. This show really represents a few scary archetypes of humanity: our inability to understand each other, our selfish desires to rule, and our yearning for true peace. These themes are represented so well with each of the characters it's ridiculous. I found myself questioning if the ""evil"" guys were really truly evil. ""Maybe the main protagonist is in the wrong"" I thought. The show is able to represent the true struggle for morality. This is why I believe this show is so beautiful. It's scary, horrific, and downright depressing. But that's humanity. It's the perfect archetype of who we are as a species. But it shows that there is hope. 10/10 masterpiece. It's perfect.",11,1,"Aug 19, 2020"

First of all the brilliantly written story with barely any plotholes. At first many things seem quite arbitrary but as more and more information gets revealed, it all starts to make sense. Almost every little detail has it's reason behind hit and because of that many hints foreshadow upcoming events. So keep an eye out when you watch it the first time around or rewatch it!

Secondly it depicts many themes relevant themes in its many story arcs like corrupt regimes or the divide between rich and poor and many more.

Lastly it has one of the best animations I've ever seen with the fluidity one feels in the actions scenes with the ODM-Gear when the characters soar through the sky.

5,i should and must rate 10 but for this,The last season episodes are turning so boring only 15mins of talking excluding the credits till now 8 episodes and each epsiode has 2 or 3mins of fight in it and the rest 14mins are a godaaam bore. Story now revolves around gabi who's now comes like field medic helping everyone and motivating what has this show come to .,10,52,"Mar 1, 2022"
10,Best anime ever,"From the first episode you are sucked into the story, I personally postponed all other things in my life to focus on finishing the first season, there is so much fear and uncertainty surrounding the titans that have mysteriously spawned in the world and have made the ignorant humanity their prey . What drives you in this show is to find out what the hell is going on, and is reflected in the characters because they too are just as oblivious to the world they live in. There is not a single filler in the 87 main episodes, there is constant conflict without it feeling overwhelming and very little moments where the show gets slow or tedious. The show deserves best anime off all time because of its insane creativity, there are never moments that feel cliche, contrived or predictable. In fact, I thought I was so smart and could predict what would happen next by season 1, but was proven wrong Im season 2 and 3. Both the sub and sub are incredible, the animation from wit and mappa were fantastic, the soundtrack is unique and beautiful and the overarching theme of war introduced in the 4th season is very thought provoking. There is no other anime like attack on titan, DEDICATE YOU HEARTS!!!!",11,1,"Dec 23, 2024"

Not watching attack on titan will be your life's greatest regret. Highly recommended please don't stop it even if you find the first season a bit slow and boring. Please do not consider this to be just an anime.

10,10/10 - A Titan Among Anime,"Having recently embarked on the epic journey that is ""Attack on Titan,"" I find myself utterly captivated and enthralled by this masterpiece of storytelling. As an avid fan of anime, including classics like Death Note and Demon Slayer, I can confidently say that ""Attack on Titan"" has carved its place as one of my all-time favorites.

From the very first episode, I was drawn into a world teeming with intrigue, betrayal, and the relentless pursuit of truth. What sets this series apart is its ability to weave a complex narrative that challenges not only the characters but also the viewers' perceptions of right and wrong. The moral ambiguity portrayed throughout the series adds layers of depth rarely seen in anime.

The animation is nothing short of breathtaking, with each frame meticulously crafted to convey the raw emotions of the characters and the intensity of their struggles. The attention to detail, especially in the action sequences, is commendable and adds to the immersive experience.

One aspect that truly shines is the character development. Watching characters evolve and grapple with their inner demons while navigating a world filled with Titans and political intrigue is both compelling and thought-provoking. Each revelation and plot twist leaves a lasting impact, keeping viewers on the edge of their seats.

The soundtrack deserves special mention, as it complements the storytelling perfectly, enhancing the emotional impact of key moments and adding depth to the overall atmosphere.

In conclusion, ""Attack on Titan"" is a tour de force in the world of anime. Its gripping storyline, dynamic characters, stunning animation, and evocative soundtrack combine to create an unforgettable viewing experience. It's a series that transcends genres and resonates with audiences on a profound level. Without a doubt, I wholeheartedly give it a perfect score of 10/10 and eagerly await future installments.",11,1,"Mar 31, 2024"

7,Epic but overwrought.,"Epic but overwrought adaptation of the popular manga series deals with humanity's attempts to ward off an onslaught on massive titans bent on consuming the human population of a large city.

Exhilarating action scenes and some very effective moments are undermined constantly by grade-school dramatics, repetition, and annoying characters (save the ass-kicking female, Mikasa). The English adaptation is okay, but at times over-the-top.

Another anime that could have been so much more had it not focused entirely on a weak cast of prepubescent teens. Thunderous music score by Hiroyuki Sawano.",6,31,"Jan 1, 2015"
3,Overhyped,"The visual style and music is good. It's a cool concept, but nothing more. There's practically no story, as nothing ever resolves and no questions are ever answered.

I was just refusing to see it ,i didnt like its posters,trailer,scenario and from what i knew it wasnt my type of show.

But i run out of big/well known anime titles and tried it at 2020. Blasted my mind away. I expected it to be ok or good but it has so many depth...I rewatched it 3 times. The only anime i have rewatched and i would rewatch it again to unravel all the characters mysteries.

10,Beautiful. Breathtaking. Heartbreaking.,"Truly, the depth of each character, the emotions displayed and the story itself spun across 4 seasons; leaves one speechless. Attack On Titan was the first anime I ever watched. I fell in love with the genre because of it, none however, will take its place as the most amazing anime I've ever seen. Truly. If you find the time to sit down, watch, learn, and understand it, you'll find yourself questioning things you never knew you'd question.

Attack On Titan is an emblazoned symbol of beauty, and depth, which will not ever be surpassed. I am grateful that I decided to sit down and take the time to soak up such amazing, entertaining, and moving anime.",11,1,"Mar 15, 2023"

10,HANDS DOWN the BEST Anime I Have EVER Seen,"Never before have I ever had a show, let alone an anime, thrill me the way Attack in Titan has. The story, up to the end of season 3, is simply incredible to follow, as there are many twists & turns that will leave you on the edge of your seat! Along the way you'll encounter emotion that is so powerful it'll actually affect you personally, most likely the type where you're grabbing the handkerchief and wiping away tears from something joyous, or tragic. I can attest to that as a particular moment in season 3 left me in a state of shock that made me literally have to pause so I could cry for a little bit... which ironically enough is what the characters were doing themselves (not exactly a spoiler as this happens a lot throughout the series). When you are watching something that is that captivating, you can't help but enjoy it! It's got a TV-MA rating too, which for an anime is rare, and in this one... it's understandable why!

I could go on and on about it, but I risk spoilers, so all I can say is this; WATCH IT!! You will not be disappointed, and more than likely, you'll find yourself turning into a fan seemingly overnight!",11,1,"Sep 12, 2019"

Attack on Titan mostly does away with anime cliches and stays original. Every episode is filled to the brim with entertainment and will keep you pressing next episode. The soundtrack is incredible and matches story beats so perfectly. There is a high level of gore, violence, and disturbing creatures which might put some people off but that is the intention of the story. Truly heartbreaking and dark story. Assuredly you will cry several times.",11,1,"Feb 21, 2024"
10,One of the best,"SNK was one of the first animes that i have ever watched, not only was the amazing first chapter that it has that got me, but the amazing writing and soundtrack that is has, from chapter one the story makes you want to see more, you wonder what is really going to happen and you want to understand everything about it.

It depends on the viewers's POV after watching it all (or reading the manga) if they are on the MC side or the others, but at beginning the story makes you want to pair with Eren, the MC.

Not only the story has really surprising plot twists, but you never really know what to expect from the characters or the story itself.

It is such a well written manga and they really made an excellent job transforming it to the amazing anime that it is today, the adaptation was flawless and correct, truly recommend to anyone that is interested on watching or reading it. 10/10.",11,1,"Feb 1, 2024"
10,Attack on titan: Peak fiction,"Attack on titan, what is it exactly? Attack on titan is an anime with creative world building. The show follows the life of Eren Yeager, a boy trapped behind walls with the rest of humanity, so why dont they just leave the walls you may ask? Titans! Unlike other shows where humans are the dominant species, titans are at the top of the food chain. Eren Yeager and his friend, Armin, wish to explore outside the walls, the only thing stopping them is the fact that thinking like this is a taboo, but like stated at the beginning ""Words cannot hold back a boys curiosity"". So what is there to like about this anime?

There are many things to like about this show, such as the voice acting, the fight scenes, and the plot twists. It holds some very famous and spectacular actors, such as Hiroshi Kayami who voice acts Levi, even better is Daisuke Ono who voice acts Erwin Smith, but the best in my opinion is Yuki Kaji who plays the role of Eren Yeager superbly. Is this all of the positives for the show? No, no it isnt. This show also displays excellent examples of serious topics, such as manipulation, morality and existentialism, which makes this show much more then just humans fighting giants. Now, are there any negatives about this show?

This anime does have some flaws, but who would expect a show not to have negatives? Hajime Isayama, the creator of this anime, created the anime with mysterious pacing, season one, for example, could have years passing in one episode, whereas later on an arc could last 2 days. This makes the show hard to keep up with. Besides this, I can't seem to notice any major negatives in the show.

So, do I recommend this anime? Yes! I do recommend it, but only to certain people. This show is more on the gory side, so this show is not targeted for those under 13 or a weak stomach, it also demonstrates topics that people are unable to understand which were mentioned in the positives. If you don't fall into any of these categories, this show is a must watch, so grab your popcorn, sit down and enjoy this show!",11,1,"Feb 10, 2024"

Attack on Titan is like Anime Game of Thrones but it's hundred times better version of Game of Thrones. Every character has some meaning and purpose. Overall I will say, everyone in this world have to watch this phenomenal series at least once before death, if you aren't planning to watch it, you don't know what you are going to miss in your precious life. Don't worry if you're not familiar with animation or anime, just watch 4-5 episodes, you'll get used to it...

10,Masterpiece. The best show I've ever watched.,"I've started watching Shingeki no Kyojin (Attack on Titan) back in 2013. Back then we only had Season 1, and I was completely blown away. So naturally instead of waiting 4 years, my impatient ass started reading the Manga. That in of itself was one hell of an experience. Waiting every month for a new chapter for pretty much 8 years (2013-2021) could drive you insane but that's a story for another day. I got to read, and when the anime resumed. Watch, the best series I've ever had the pleasure of following.

Watching Shingeki no Kyojin is, as many people have stated before, watching history being made. This show is anything but normal, and I'm 99% sure you've never seen anything quite like it- Every detail counts, It has just the right amount of foreshadowing, Everything Connects, the Protagonist goes through the best character development I've ever seen, the Soundtrack is amazing, the Directing is on another level, and so, so much more stuff I simply won't get into right now.

This short review didn't even cover 1% of why I like this show so much and why it means so much to me, but I really do hope it was enough to get you to watch this masterpiece, or at the very least give it the shot it rightfully deserves. This series influenced me as a Person, and I will forever be grateful to Hajime Isayama for creating it.",7,0,"Feb 4, 2022"

7,"Hmmmm, not bad but it isn't that great either as people make it it out to be.","Let me say that the animation, the music, the fighting scenes, the shock factor are top notch. Surprise attacks and scenes make this one hell of a show. However, as a viewer, I find it very hard to sit through all the talking and chitchat which prolongs even more than expected. Knowing every detail isn't necessary nor is knowing every person's point of view. Half of season four could be cut down from all the chitchat. Season 1 and 2 are amazing. Season 3 is great and has some very emotional scenes. The fourth season is excellent as well. With season 4, I find it very annoying how this little girl whose loud and raging on, can't seem to shut up. Or how there are so many scenes about her and what she's doing. When there is so much happening and the political landscape is moving, I want to know what's going on around the soldiers with the protagonist and the enemy, what they are doing to fight back. I can't pretty much watch anything but man is it hard watching people talk and talk constantly from one episode to the next. Also, when there is a fight scene, in the middle of the fight, the scene goes somewhere else. This happens many times. While I am trying to see what happens next, another 5 to 10 minutes goes to some other scene. I get it, you want to prolong the awesome fight scenes but that should be the makers of the show, their job to mash everything together well. I know am being critical about a lot of things but this is my honest review. It is not as great as people make it sound like. Like I said, it has some great stuff but it lacks in other areas. Lastly, the term devil and God are thrown around so much. Japanese writersclaim Titans as God, people as God which is very irritating. They seem to put this mumbo jumbo into many of their animes. The story isn't as interesting or appealing either. Who cares about the origin but this is the issue with Japanese anime, they have to over explain every single thing to the letter. If you watch a lot of anime, you'll understand exactly what I am saying. I am still not done talking about the Akuma (devil) and Kami (God). It is a brilliant show but it is not the best. Not even close. It may perhaps be in the top 10 shows no doubt. Anyways, food for thought.",5,28,"Nov 2, 2023"
2,"There's something here, but they haven't found it","Attack on Titan has a lot of things going for it. It's based on an incredible, award winning manga. It's got a killer animation studio producing it with a bold visual style. It's got a gritty soundtrack.

But it does not understand what makes a story compelling or a series enjoyable. Every installment ends on a cliffhanger, typically with the characters more beaten down and miserable than they started. This creates a gloomy monotony that drags you from episode to episode.

The show is dark and violent, but if the story was paced differently there would be some tonal variety. Additionally, it would allow them to invest the audience in the characters before mortally wounding them. The way the show is structured, it whisks you through characters building a relationship with each other and cuts right to the fighting. It never earns its action scenes or emotional plot points.

The only reasons to care about a character are a) you like the character design, b) you like the trope assigned to that character, or c) you are heavily invested enough in the main character to care how he feels about this new person. Considering that the main character is your typical shounen action hero, that last one is a tough sell.

In 2020 when the Attack on Titan was hyped up again, and all my buddies told me to try out this anime, Best Decision of my Life. Then I started watching from S2 but didn't get what was going on since I vaguely remembered the characters and was confused between Sasha and Hange 😂 Then I re-watched S1 and continued until I reached S3 part 2 where everything made sense but confusing. That's where that anime gets an amazing Narrative and from that point onwards the story is perfect and Absolute Peak.

10,"Not a big fan of Anime but this show has me hook, line and sinker","Only started this because I was sick and it was on Netflix. I was not and still am not into Anime (except OPM), but this show and the comics are amazing and epic. Great storytelling, character arcs, suspense, comedy, twists, turns, worldbuilding and emotion. On the edge of my seat for what happens next.",7,0,"Jun 6, 2019"
10,Greatest piece of fiction created of all time,"My mate was recommending me this show for ages saying it's the greatest piece of fiction ever and I was thinking he was just a weird anime fan that was super bias but I was very wrong

So full backstory after I finished Breaking Bad in 2023 I was convinced I wouldn't find a show better or on the same level as breaking bad for decades.

Then a year later I watched attack on Titan and after the first season I thought it was better then I expected and could be a very solid show but not even close to breaking bad. Then I watched season 2 and it just got that much better from an already amazing season then season 3 comes around and is probably a top 5 season to any show ever, so a masterpiece.

By then I was thinking this has a chance to pass up breaking bad, although a very slim chance because if season 4 didn't wrap up the show perfectly it couldn't be better then breaking bad.

Then I watch season 4 and by the end of the show and after a month of thinking on it, my mate was right when he said it is the greatest piece of fiction ever created because it absolutely is.

There are an infinite number of reasons why it's the greatest show ever so I don't even know how to explain it but if you have seen the show you'll know.

And if I'm going to the moment I was convinced of aot being the greatest piece of fiction ever it happened after finishing season 4 episode 20 memories of the future. This episode and the plot twist within it is the greatest plot twist ever in anything along with being the greatest episode of any show ever and when finishing that episode I realised this show is and will probably always be the greatest piece of fiction ever created.

10,Changed my perspective,"I have never dedicated my life to something so much before attack on titan. Every twist and turn every revelation made me enjoy the show more and made me wonder whether or not I was watching the show properly. I have rewatched this series many times but still find new clues and hints Isayama had left throughout the series its makes it more enjoyable each time.

One main thing that I love is that to my knowledge there is no fan service so I am able to enjoy the show without have to skip anything and also I can share the show with many others for them to enjoy too. Romance is a bit of a small side of the story bin my opinion but it never takes away from the actual story and what is being conveyed.

This is the greatest anime I have ever watched and will continue to rewatch and share with others.",7,0,"Nov 25, 2024"

10,Truly a peice of Art,"""Attack on Titan"" is a remarkable anime that enthralls with its gripping story and gorgeous visuals. It explores themes of survival and the resiliency of the human spirit in a world under siege by enormous Titans. Its unwavering examination of moral uncertainty and the difficulties of war is what distinguishes it as extraordinary. Each of the well-developed characters has a unique set of goals and burdens that allow the audience to identify with them. Taking viewers right into the action, the animation is nothing short of amazing. ""Attack on Titan"" delivers an engrossing experience that reverberates long after the screen goes black, thanks to an enormous music that intensifies every scene. The anime industry has never been the same after this series. It will be remembered as a timeless classic.",7,0,"May 19, 2024"
10,The best piece of fiction,"In the vast landscape of fiction, certain narratives rise above the rest, capturing the hearts and minds of audiences worldwide. Among these towering achievements stands Hajime Isayama's masterpiece, Attack on Titan. Through its gripping storytelling, complex characters, and profound themes, Attack on Titan has carved a place for itself as one of the greatest works of fiction in contemporary media.

At the heart of Attack on Titan lies its exploration of the human condition in the face of adversity. Set in a world besieged by colossal humanoid creatures known as Titans, humanity clings to survival within massive walled cities. Yet, despite the physical barriers that separate them from annihilation, the characters grapple with internal struggles, moral dilemmas, and the existential dread that accompanies their precarious existence. Through their trials, the series delves into the depths of human resilience, courage, and the capacity for both cruelty and compassion.

One of the most compelling aspects of Attack on Titan is its portrayal of characters who are neither wholly good nor entirely evil. Protagonists and antagonists alike are imbued with shades of gray, each driven by their own motivations, fears, and convictions. Eren Yeager, the series' central figure, evolves from a vengeful youth seeking retribution against the Titans to a complex and conflicted leader burdened by the weight of his choices. Similarly, other characters such as Levi Ackerman, Mikasa Ackerman, and Reiner Braun undergo profound transformations, challenging the audience's perceptions and eliciting empathy for even the most morally ambiguous figures.

Furthermore, Attack on Titan tackles weighty themes such as power, freedom, and the nature of truth. The struggle between the oppressive government and the insurgent Survey Corps reflects real-world tensions surrounding authority, rebellion, and the quest for liberty. As the characters uncover the mysteries of their world and confront uncomfortable truths, they are forced to reevaluate their beliefs and confront the inherent complexities of existence. This intellectual depth elevates Attack on Titan beyond mere entertainment, inviting viewers to ponder profound philosophical questions and engage with the material on a deeper level.

Moreover, the series distinguishes itself through its masterful storytelling and meticulously crafted world-building. From the intricately designed Titan anatomy to the meticulously plotted narrative twists, every aspect of Attack on Titan demonstrates a commitment to excellence and attention to detail. Isayama's skillful pacing keeps audiences on the edge of their seats, while his deft handling of foreshadowing and symbolism rewards attentive viewers with layers of meaning and significance. The result is a narrative tapestry that is as immersive as it is thought-provoking, drawing audiences into a world both familiar and alien, where every revelation brings new questions and discoveries.

In addition to its narrative prowess, Attack on Titan boasts stunning visuals and visceral action sequences that leave a lasting impression on viewers. The towering Titans, rendered with terrifying detail, inspire awe and dread in equal measure, while the fluid animation and dynamic cinematography bring the high-stakes battles to life with breathtaking intensity. Whether soaring through the skies on 3D maneuver gear or clashing with Titans in desperate close-quarters combat, the series' action sequences are a testament to the talent and dedication of its creators, captivating audiences with their spectacle and emotional resonance.

Beyond its artistic merits, Attack on Titan has left an indelible mark on popular culture, inspiring countless adaptations, spin-offs, and fan works. Its themes and imagery have permeated the global consciousness, sparking discussions and debates among fans and critics alike. From cosplay conventions to academic symposiums, Attack on Titan continues to captivate audiences of all ages and backgrounds, transcending the boundaries of genre and medium to become a cultural phenomenon in its own right.

In conclusion, Attack on Titan stands as a testament to the power of storytelling to transcend boundaries and inspire audiences around the world. Through its exploration of the human condition, its richly developed characters, and its thought-provoking themes, the series has earned its place among the pantheon of great works of fiction. As it nears its conclusion, Attack on Titan leaves behind a legacy that will endure for generations to come, reminding us of the boundless potential of the human imagination and the enduring power of a compelling story well told.",7,0,"May 13, 2024"

10,This Has To be one of the Best series ever made...!,"Before some of you start arguing that ""THIS SHOW IS OVERRATED"" I would like to tell you all... WHY this is one of the best show. And if you are planning to watch this series I HIGHLY SUGGEST you read this review so you can get an idea of what you are getting into.

1 Animation (9/10) Clean Animation is a crucial part when it comes to Anime. There is CGI and Hand Drawn animation, Wit Studio (S1-S3 part 2) used Fully 3D rendered backgrounds which are Smooth for fast action sequences supported with Beautiful Hand Drawn Animation for many action sequences Which is stunning, also Wit Studio used Amazing Contrasting colours with good details in Characters along with Fluid Animation which looks Amazingly Beautiful.

2 Story (10/10) AOT has one of the most Deep, Thrilling and Detailed Plot. This Anime serie has a Plot which Surpasses many Movies and Dramas in terms of its storyline. Set in a Fictional World the story also talks and tells about things like Racism, Equality and Freedom and how badly they affect the society. The show set's a goal for each mission then gets into action. The tension build about the Basement and the Power of titans are amazingly revealed in all seasons with many hints you will notice of you rewatch AOT. I am keeping this spoiler free so I will not say much but if you're going to watch this then you are gonna love it. Some parts of the story may be complicated to understand if you don't pay attention on subtitles, so I recommend that you try to understand the hints and parts because they will lead to amazing reveals as you keep watching.

3 Music (9/10) AOT has one of the best and original Soundtracks which do an amazing job in creating Tension, building Curiosity and making very emotional atmosphere/mood. You will love it

And Lastly shout out to Studio MAPPA for Animating Final Season. It was absolute Blast watching it the soundtracks, the animation and the War kind of theme was very exciting and fun to watch.

This Anime has Climbed on top along with Hunter X Hunter, Black Clover and many amazing series. Watch it because there is no way you will not like it.",7,0,"Oct 10, 2021"

There are too many unnecessary explanatory monologues and diologues instead of getting into action. The storytelling is indeed bad. There is no strong character development and I don't even have one single favourite character in these series.

10,My favorite anime yet!,"Nothing has ever made me feel emotions as strong as Attack on Titan. A recurring complaint from people is that Eren is a very irritating protagonist. That may be subjective, in my opinion, he is irritating, but his backstory is set well enough that you understand him and his anger. I absolutely love the characters (except Gabi, but she was written that way and has her reasons), each of them have a role to fulfill, and while not all of them have a tragic past or an inspiring story, that makes them all the more realistic, and they're all fun to watch. I was drawn into the show from the first episode itself, and I just couldn't stop watching. There's so much suspense, and the twists are mind blowing. There are admittedly, quite a lot of deaths but they all have meaning and a purpose to serve. The soundtracks and openings are absolutely amazing, and the best, in my opinion. There's a LOT of gore and violence and it's mostly grim and dark so I understand that might put off some people, but personally it's just my type. The story has no fanservice and the lessons it teaches are very realistic. The most important thing I've learnt is ""perspectives"".

1,How a masterpiece was absolutely massacred.,"Attack on Titan went from being one of my favorite animes to an absolutely overrated, bland and generic trash anime.

The first two seasons were amazing, season 3 part 1 was not that good, but season 3 part 2 compensated for that. It's also worth noting that the plot twists in the first three seasons were great, but then we come to The Final Season Part 1, The Final Season Part 2, The Final Season Part 3 Part 1, The Final Season Part 3 Part 2 (No, that's not a typo they actually made 4 final seasons).

AoT had this special type of animation that no other anime had, but after MAPPA took over, the animation was pretty much as the animation of a niche anime that no one watches, also the amount of CGI, oh god... . The first couple of episodes of season 4 part 1 were actually good, but after that the anime started to feel like a typical cliché fantasy anime with its typical bland plot. It really is a shame how a masterpiece was literally butchered.",46,419,"Mar 26, 2023"

On top of that, if the studio successfully delivers part two of season four of this series, then I have no doubt saying that this series deserves minimum a 9.5 or 9.6.

10,A Masterpiece of Hajime Isayama,"Season 1-3 it is just a brilliant action thriller mystery. But when season 4 starts it is not just a attack on titan. You will see how Isayama brings out the deepest human traits through his absolutely well written characters. The characters in Attack on Titan tell us that there are no heros or villains or anti-heros in the world and everyone has their reasons for doing so. I am surprised how Isayama justify each and every character specially the protagonist; Eren Yeager. The protagonist you find in Attack on Titan is totally different than all the protagonists you have ever encountered. I recommend you to watch Attack on Titan if only you are ready to face the reality of the world. Unless you will be heartbroken.

10,Masterpiece! Mind Blowing! Emotional! Goosebumps! No words to describe.,"There are no words to describe this emotional masterpiece! I couldn't say this is the second best anime which I watched but I can say this series is on par with "" Death Note ""!! Right from the first episode it'll grip you to your seats and makes you feel wonder what on earth are these man-eating giants and where the hell did they come from. Credits goes to the story writer, direction and the entire audio department for the work they did in combining the visual wonders with epic BGM's everywhere. Particularly this BGM "" Vogel Im Kafig "" translates to "" Bird in a Cage "", I'm not sure how many times I've listened to this song but whenever I listen to this song or watch the episode related to this there will be goosebumps all over my body!!!

The Character portrayal, the background settings, dialogue content and most importantly the Emotional Quotient in this series links you to almost every character and makes you feel as if you're carried away by the story. I've tried to control myself on not reading the manga but as a result I finished reading all the chapters. Since I'm a good human I prefer not to disclose anything ;).....No Spoilers hahaha.

I suggest any anime lover to watch this series and enjoy the visual and emotional brilliance as all the episodes are soon to be released on netflix or you can watch them on CRUNCHYROLL!! Do use this Corona time to complete this series and kill your boredom!! Happy Watching.",14,2,"Apr 10, 2020"
10,Not a fan of anime in general BUT....,"I have to start by saying i always found anime cringe and corny to be honest. After many of my friends insisted me to watch it (to the point it was tiring) i gave it a try. It didn´t change my mind firstly i mean you could still find cringness particularly with the unnecesary screaming and overdramatic scenes. However i was humbled by the deepnesss in the premise and i decided to keep watching it. SPOILER ALERT: The best decision in my life.

After season 2 i thought it would be better to watch it along with some youtube reactor channels, wich i really suggest for those new in the anime world (i suggest Blindwave or RTTV but whoever you choose you will find it will help). After watching it all im convinced this is the best show ever (-and yes i watched Got, The Wire, BB, Sopranos, Severance and so on). I can 100% admit it overpassed all of those. AOT was my gateway door to anime and sadly it ruined everything from then since nothing can top the quality and the emotions i feel after the end of every episode. Fmab, Death Note, Code Geass, are great but none of them really grabbed me like AOT did. I found myself shouting to the screen from time to time like it was a football match (yes i was that obsessed with it giving indications to the characters Lol)

I didn´t read the manga but for what i know this is the best show ever. I hope they don´t make a Got move and ruined by the end. I hope they don´t.",14,2,"Mar 22, 2023"

While the start of the show seems like your typical shounen, season 4 was truly a tide turner that MUST be watched. I'm saddened from the amount of people who told me they dropped attack on titan once starting season 4, but the connection between seasons 1-3 and 4 is something you can only truly understand once you have watched it. I'll never not get chills when watching the show, and rewatching scenes/episodes from the old seasons (1-3) is so mindblowing once you know everything from season 4. THANK YOU ISAYAMA!!!",17,3,"May 21, 2023"
10,One of the rarest perfect shows in the world.,"I don't know how Isayama sir, a single man handled the whole Aot universe. It's incredible. Still there are some unsettling things and complaining situations for me. But first of all, it has mind blowing OST, Op, Background music.. etc, whatnot. Incredible direction of action scenes and it's camera angles. And for story line will take deep on politics events, military and war.

Best character development Levi to Eren. Levi is humanity s strongest soldier. Honestly I completed season 1,2,3 one of the reason is Levi. Attack On Titan is an epic anime but main protagonist (Eren) power abilities are low in first season 3 seasons. So I'm a little little disappointed in it. But after season 4 this is the situation. Season 1 - 9, Season 2 - 8.5, Season 3 part 1 - 9, season 3 part 2 - 9, Season 4 - 10, Season 4 Part 2 - 8.5. Season 4 is top in my Aot seasons list.

Now, Eren Yeager name is sign of terror. Freakingly badass, freakingly cool and protagonist to antagonist, terrific change over for Eren. Season 4 is new beginning and ending for Aot.

But after waiting for a year, finally time has come. Watching part 2 of season 4 first part is devastating epic. Second half of the part was bombed off. They should have made episode 80 is ending of this series. That, Gabi was acting as a protagonist. If there is any flaw in series is only that.",17,3,"May 4, 2022"

The brilliant and compelling characters, and the world they live in feels as though the writers really put a lot of thought into it. It's very fleshed out which just adds to the immersion whilst watching it. You feel fully invested in each episode and on the edge of your seat during cliffhangers or revelations; of which there's plenty thanks to the clever and ever expanding storyline. It's not slapdash or strange and difficult to follow like some lesser anime's, it's genuinely wonderful writing.

Throw in the amazing soundtrack, the adrenaline filled action and fight scenes, and the heart warming characters, their relationships and emotion that is displayed from great voice actors (English version and Japanese) and you have a show that no others will come close to for a very long time.

You'll have to sit through a lot of so-called deep psychology (characters bulging their eyes and thinking about dead whoevers which they have to avenge.) Too many pep-talks. Action sequences are well-paced but sparse.

The animation is surprising and cleverly incorporates medieval aesthetics. The ""camera movement"", so to speak, is amazing. All in all, this anime is visually pleasing and suggestive, however, the story unfolds too slowly and in too a predictable way.",6,46,"Jan 31, 2015"

I understand this is an apocalyptic event and the creator's are trying to portray how young adults would react to a situation like they are put in but it's still extremely excessive. There's also a lot of events that happen that are never explained fully or not at all leaving it open for interpretation or another season to play out. I feel like this series is ridiculously over hyped compared to most anime I have watched and shouldn't receive the praise it has got.",14,101,"Aug 9, 2017"
10,What a Story...,"I love anime, but this wasn't the type of anime that I consider anime, so I didn't like it at first but Attack on Titan sits on a whole other level of amazing writing and anime, but its not like your traditional anime.

The way the story unfolds retelling a narrative about how racism works, was so well written and engaging, that I almost could not comprehend what I was watching, with the first season where the plot seemed to be a very basic revenge story between humans stuck living inside mysterious walls and their nemesis, humanoid titans which seems to exist with the sole purpose of eating humans alive.

It soon became more, and soon real feelings of anger or even love, started to be exhibited within me, when I focussed on certain characters. Attack on Titan is so much more than what we originally thought it was... From the parallelisms with the real world depicting themes like war, greed, complacency, the inherit curiosity for exploration all the way to the notion of slavery, the Black experience, colonialism and the damaging affect of imperialism.

Ambiguity is an ever present concept in our lives, and this show depicts it like very few do, this associated with how brilliant the characters evolve throughout all 4 seasons its remarkable, you can empathize with someone that made the most awful things and that shows how brilliant the creator is.

Adding to all the above, you will be facing many mind blowing twists and unexpected dark turns on the story, with one of the best animation work I've ever seen on screen, specially the most recent episodes - considering this started almost 10 years ago!

Outstanding soundtrack, I get the chills on many of the fight scenes and of course it goes without saying that the fights themselves are brilliant, nerve wracking and make you so hyped with all of the elements of the action combined, really a one of a kind TV show, and so ordinary TV seems almost pointless.

I am eagerly waiting for the final part next year it's a masterpiece and I don't say that lightly.",22,5,"Oct 17, 2022"

10,Seasons 1-3A 9/10. Season 3B onwards 10/10,"This is possibly the most intricately plotted story told in the modern day. Just rewatching the show again everything makes an insane amount of sense and the foreshadowing for events that occur seasons later is mindblowing.

The show sets up mysteries, and pays them off in ways youd never expect, but make absolute sense. There are barely any flaws in this story whatoever, constantly delivering on action and story payoffs.

10,The Final Season,"Is a game changer. Anime was already incredible but other seasons had too many monologues and stalling it felt, even with very interesting story and action. But the 4th season is just pure perfection, the way everything ties up and flows is mindblowing. It's not even over yet and there's a feeling of accomplishment already. Very complex story that may take a couple of times to fully grasp or at least grasp enough to enjoy it. Can't believe this world was built by pure imagination.",29,8,"Jan 15, 2022"
10,Quite possibly the greatest tv show...ever,"If you're reading this and you haven't started Attack on Titan yet, I'm jealous. I'm jealous that you have the opportunity to experience its twists and turns for the first time. I'm jealous that you get to feel that shiver that goes down your spine when watching episodes that make your jaw drop... that are objectively the pinnacle of visual storytelling.

But opportunities are worthless if they're not taken advantage of. This is your invitation.

Watch it. Watch this show, and don't fool yourself into thinking it'll be 4 seasons of monsters eating people. It's so much more than that. You'll cry. You'll rejoice. You'll experience the rarest of sensations with modern tv shows-genuinely having no clue what's coming next.

If you normally don't watch anime but heard about this show, give it a try. You won't regret it. Atlanta, Breaking Bad and the Wire are some of the only shows that reach these heights.

4,Not really that great,"Basically, the only interesting part of this show is when the main character transforms into a Titan and fights back. The rest of the time the show mostly consists of 'flat' banter or backstory coupled with 'so-so' dialogue. I'm a few episodes into the second season and technology still does not really make any sense or have much consistency, and the characters seem to only be introduced to die in some overly graphic way that involves them pleading while suffering immensely. It's a dark show (which i usually don't mind) but the dialogue and the overall 'torture porn' narrative leaves me unsatisfied and kinda bored. Additionally, most of the time characters are behaving so stupid or slow i find myself rooting for them to be eating so the scene gets over with quicker.

10,The pinnacle of human imagination,"After I saw the last episode a couple of days ago I was sure of one thing, Attack on titan is a work of art, a masterpiece, and the embodiment of sheer perfection. I cannot describe what I felt when watching this show, but I will do my best in this review.

I started watching AOT in 2021. I had heard a lot of great things about it, but i never really knew what it was about. I still remember watching the first episode inside my family's car thinking it was going to have a generic plot where the MC gets stronger and stronger through training until they are able to defeat their enemy(the titans). To keep it short, I did not know what was coming my way. The firsts season focuses on world building and introducing us to the characters and the show, but I still think it was entertaining and interesting. Then came season two, showing us a small part of the greatness that was about to come. Then came season 3 and 4, and even though only season 3 was enough to convince me that AOT is one of the greatest shows of all time, season 4 ensured its number one spot. You may ask, what makes it so great though? Well, let me tell you what makes it so great. The story begins with a very simplistic world. A world where there are large giants who eat people, but the people are kept safe enclosed in walls. But somehow, Hajime Isayama is able to turn this simpel idea into a complex, mind boggling story through plot twists, reveals, and a change of narrative. I my self am not able to truly speak on this show, because i cannot even form sentences well enough to truly capture its dept. I don't want to spoil anything, which makes what I say a little dull and you might not be able to understand its greatness. But trust me, coming from a person who has watched Game of Thrones, Breaking Bad, Vinland Saga and many more shows, Attack On titan is on another level. I used to think GOT was the best show of all time, but with AOTs final season released it made the story complete, which made me able to understand its entirety(making it a million times better than GOT). It is just so good. NO like you have to watch it. Forgive me being informal but just watch, watch it, watch it NOOOOOW. I would be glad if this was the legacy of the entire human races accomplishments. It is that good. I am happy that I was born, because I was able to witness peak fiction and the pinnacle of human creativity and imagination. This show displayed to the world what perfection is. I am not overreacting, nor am I hyping this show up for no reason. WATCH IT AND SEE WHAT I MEEEAAAAN!!!!!!",16,3,"Nov 17, 2023"

10,My heart belongs to this unforgettable anime,"I have been watching watching Attack on Titan since four years and I finally decided to write a review, especially since the show is coming to an end soon... I have to say, there's something about this anime that just captures my heart and soul.

What I love most about Attack on Titan is that it doesn't rely on simplistic notions of good and evil. Instead, the show dives deep into the complexities of human nature and how our perspectives shape our actions. This is what sets Attack on Titan apart from other anime, and it's what keeps me coming back for more. It's not like most animes, about a hero against a villain, since the MC himself is not considered as a hero but a Anti-Hero.

But it's not just the philosophical depth that makes this show so compelling. The amount of realism in Attack on Titan is simply breathtaking. The show doesn't shy away from the cruel realities of human nature and the horrors of war. Instead, it confronts these topics head-on, forcing us to grapple with them in a way that few other shows do.

And then there's the amazing foreshadowing. Attack on Titan is a master class in how to plant seeds of plot and character development. Every episode is packed with hidden clues and subtle hints that leave me amazed

All in all, Attack on Titan is an unforgettable anime and has left an indelible mark on me.

10,INCREDIBLE!,"Where to start with this anime, WOW.

I guess, I first gave it a try 3-4 years ago, got about 6-7 episodes in, went onto something else, no reason. I came back and binged the entire show a month ago, with no biased towards liking it or not.

All I can say, is go into this as a blank slate, and you'll be treated to one of the best emotional rides ever. I don't even want to spoil ANYTHING in this review. If horror/action/sci-fi/drama is your thing, and it does all of these VERY well. This is 100% for you. The first watch thru is something special, the fear and dread you'll have for characters. They did a brilliant job creating a realistic world in AOT. You believe everything you're seeing in their reality.

Along with the brilliant writing and characters. The art style is unique and can be beautiful at times, the wide landscapes look amazing. They do a great job limiting and blending that 3D rendered style, which I DO NOT like. The 4th season starts to get a little heavy with it, but it's not terrible, I'm REALLY picky about it lmao. Music/voice acting is top notch. I watched the English dub on Crunchy Roll, Bryce does an amazing job as Eren, you can feel the hatred at times.

Eren.

Eren, has become my hands down favourite character, even outside anime. I tried to view this anime from a certain perspective. That perspective I think is why I love his character and story so much. I'm still amazed with the depth they were able to give so many characters, it's truly a special ride.

The only spoiler I'll say, the writer knew exactly what he was doing the entire time, and they weren't afraid to shock you. There's so much, 2nd, 3rd watches you'll be finding something new. Now go watch.

That being said, the show is stretched out to the edge of insanity. One episode is around 25 minutes, and except for the first 3-4 episodes, any other episode can be wrapped in 2-3 minutes tops.

Starting episode 5-6 you can literally watch the opening of the episode, skip to the middle to check if you missed any cool action scenes, then just skip to the end, to figure out what happened. Every 5-6 episodes you might realize you missed something, but you can easily just rewind a bit, and you've saved yourself hours of meaningless watchtime.

There was literally one episode where the main character fell, and the whole 25 minutes was revolving around him getting up again. UNBELIEVABLE. No plot, no story, no action, NOTHING. Fillers, fillers, fillers and more fillers.

10,Everyone praises it (which is well deserved) so I'm gonna say some negative things to balance out (Kinda failed),"First of all, I will say that this anime is in my top 3. I haven't finished it yet, I didn't like the animation style of the 4th season because wit studios animation style was just iconic. Mappa just made it a bit more ""Modern"" imo. The story is great, the characters are good bla bla bla. There are roughly 2000 reviews here saying these things and I know you know these things too well.

Now, lets get started with the negative things, first: First season have so many still shots. Bro i can't even come up with bad things about this anime. Like I just sit there and thought for like 15 minutes and only things i can think of is still shots (which wasn't that noticible because they used them in slice of life episodes) and 4th seasons animation style change. Style change isn't bad it is just different from what i've used to up until know. Maybe Pacing of the 4th season (I said I didn't finished it I watched like 11-12 episodes).

This review is pretty useless but I think i proved something with it:

Every season, was a masterpiece. The OST, the greatest of all time. The characters, masterfully put together. The animation? Absolutely Beautiful.

And most importantly, the story itself, is truly the best of all time.

5,Attack on nothing,"My problem with Shingeki No Kyojin is that it doesn't work as an anime, and I'm going to explain this quite briefly.

First of all, I would like to tell what I really like about this anime, and I think that we should agree about one thing: the combats are amazing. Differently from the cinema, we see movement in quite every moment; we don't have the feeling of the character moving while attacking, but we directly see it. This is quite a hard job, since in the cinema, our first and closest reference, we only get a perception and a lot of cuts in the screen don't allow to see every single second. Next, I would like to talk about the Female Titan. I think that the two blocks in the story that concern this character are very well made, the first one being in the forest, with this scene where the characters are the Key to throw, and then when it comes into the city (not because of the plotwist, because I don't really care about who this character really is, but about how it is taken into a little screen, TV). And last but not least, the quality of the drawing of Attack On Titan is really amazing.

But as an anime, I don't think it does really work and I'm going to explain why, and this last good point on the anime allows me to introduce the first bad: as the drawing is that well made, it is impossible to have the rest of the series well animated. If we do not look the combats, the rest of AOT is really mediocre. In the most part of episodes, we have an scenario that tries to open slowly and not certainly, but we do not see life in it. The characters talk and nothing around moves. The series is basically limited to an horizontal or vertical movement of camera with a drawing that does not move, and this is not animation. There is also a thing that enervates me about AOT, and it is the flat resources it uses. The characters only move their eyes to show feelings (fear, sadness, whatever). I know this is a technique used in most of the shonen, but here, they go too far. If we take off this flat resource, there would be 5 episodes less. And finally, I have to talk about how superficial AOT is. It tries to talk about serious subjects, but it does it in the clumsiest possible way. We see gore, we see children crying and whatever, but it only stays in the background and it never deepens about it. I have to add that almost no character is well developed. We have for example Eren Jager: he sees how his mother dies and seeks revenge against the Titans. The only thing he does is to cry and scream (this is what characters do all the time: they scream a lot and they move their eyes). He joins a group to face the Titans and that's all. It is true that he becomes a Titan himself, that it adds a couch of interest to his character, but everything he does is because of the anime script's needs, and not because he is well developed as a character. In the other side, we have Mikasa who talks a lot less and who seems mystic. She works a lot better than Eren as a character because all she does is physic, but she has no development as in the first episode she is exactly the same that in the last. We have Armin, and he is the only one to be a bit developed as he is a boy who suffered from bullying, he sees a lot of things that make him go crazy and this is moderately well done, not incredibly because the anime is as it is and we can't ask much of it. When I watched Serial Experiments Lain, Paranoia Agent, Madoka Magica, Death Note... Well, a lot of animes that I like much more than this one, I remembered the names of the characters because they were interesting. In this case, I don't care if a Titan takes Eren and rips his head off (this does not happen, hm).

So in the end, is Attack On Titan a bad anime? Not a bad one, but a mediocre work. I'm not criticizing its adaptation as I have not read the manga (and I don't care about it). What I am talking about is the anime, so anything against this last argument won't be taken as true.

Nothing else to add.",12,89,"Dec 15, 2016"

And I don't wanna sound like that guy but I rarely ever cry. The scores on this anime go so well with everything that is going on in the show at the moment. Even the end credits music of each episode is so good and sort of captures the emotions of that part of the season or half season whatever.

This show is very emotional throughout the beginning but the 3rd and 4th season take you on an emotional roller coaster. It's a bit crazy how much it moves you because the main character is very cheery and happy in the beginning of the show but over the course of the story he begins to see how the world he lives in is anything but that. It impacts him in such a way I can't even explain because he turns into a totally different person by the end of the story. The side characters in this anime are also some of the best written characters in existence of entertainment media alone. I'm not spoiling anything but there are lots of tragic moments in this anime and you'll FEEL each and every one of them.

Lastly the plot of this series is so intricate and complex. It's done so god damn well and I can't begin to praise the writers and the author of the manga enough for what they have done to make this. There are so many twists that you really don't see coming and those twists are so crazy that I really can't even compare them to a twist in any other show or movie that I've seen and I've seen a ton of mind twist movies. I like the mystery element that the plot brings to the mix a lot and it really keeps you at the edge of your seat.

Overall this anime is a must watch, it's dark, gory, bloody, sad, emotional, and complex I think that this anime really boils down to a good mix of everything that I really wanna see in a show or an anime.

I do hope that they change the ending of this show though It gets a bit too sad in the manga.",10,1,"May 12, 2023"

10,The first anime since 97's Berserk that sated my thirst for dark tales,"Majority of shows tend to slightly to moderately drop in quality over many seasons. There are very few exceptions - and Attack on Titan is without doubt one of them.

I started watching it in 2013, desperately hungering for more and more. I watched this show's growth and aging, and with years it was better and better. Just like a good wine.

I'm 30 now, and I'm well over shounen genre. Sure, there are load of great shounen series, but what I want is maturity, taste of real life struggle, stories in which good guys don't always win. After finishing Berserk, I was left empty and thirsty for dark tales, bittersweet juice of life. And Attack on Titan provided it, in big fashion.

I like everything about this show - story, lore, characters, animation, exceptional soundtrack, pacing, sense of mystery, uncertainty. This is one of the best anime series of all time, and it's nearing its end. Such a shame...

Do yourself a favor and watch it.

I just hope waiting for next great series like AoT or Berserk will not be too long.

10,Legitimately pro,"This the best anime series which I have seen in my live.""Attack on Titan"" is a popular Japanese manga and anime series created by Hajime Isayama. Set in a world where humanity resides within enormous walled cities to protect themselves from gigantic humanoid creatures known as Titans, the story follows protagonist Eren Yeager and his friends as they join the military to fight against the Titans and uncover the mysteries surrounding their existence. Filled with intense action, complex characters, and themes of survival, betrayal, and sacrifice, ""Attack on Titan"" has captivated audiences worldwide with its gripping narrative and stunning animation.",10,1,"Feb 28, 2024"
9,A masterpiece,"I have seen a lot of animes and all kinds of shows and I must say, that the first 6-8 episodes of Attack on Titan, are in my opinion, the pinnacle of anime series so far. The plot, the characters, the animation, the soundtrack...are all top notch. Special mention for the first opening: epic is the word for it. Try and watch the first 5 episodes and you won't be disappointed.",33,10,"Apr 16, 2017"

10,Absolutely gorgeous,"Gorgeous. This word can fully describe everything what I think of Attack on Titan. Gorgeous plot, gorgeous characters, gorgeous dark fantasy world, gorgeous art style&spec effects, gorgeous music, gorgeous structure of the show, GOD – IT'S ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS!!! There is no other anime like this, that could be so GORGEOUS IN EVERY WAY! It just doesn't have any flaws at all! The way WIT studio has shown this anime is so brilliant, unique and groundbreaking that I have no other choice than to say: ""This is an Everest of anime industry""... , and I swear on my soul – it's true.

To say that I did not expect something like that from a newbie studio (which WIT really was back than) means not to say anything at all. Their first project and such a success. That can only be recognized as a work of genius, and in this case genius is a whole studio. Most of all I can praise the producer – Jouji Wada, the director – Tetsurou Araki and the composer – Hiroyuki Sawano. The magic that appeared on the screen immediately dragging me to the fantasy world; the flawless music consuming me like a black hole and bringing me to new dimension of overflowing joy; the endless feeling of agony, pain and hopelessness but still not surrendering, not backing down and to the very last breath struggling emotion – the enjoyment is indescribable. Everything that our heroes 've been through and each and every emotion they've felt – I felt as well: when they were happily crying seeing each other alive – I was happily crying with them; when they were angry or frustrated – I felt the same; when they where dying on the battlefield or sacrificing themselves to save their sworn brothers – I was dying there as well. The creators 've managed to show every single detailed emotion on the faces of main, and secondary characters as well, and 've made you to walk through this path along with them ""from the cradle to the grave"".

The story line is thought-out, unique and figuratively does imply to our real world in many aspects of life such as social differentiations and human animal nature. Beautifully done job by Isayama Hajime takes you to new horizons of dark horror fantasy and allows you to feel its greatness on your own skin. The art style is colorful and detailed, and in addition to high level 3d animation and dynamic effects puts some kind of enchantment on you and makes you 5-year old kid that still believes in miracles.

Special attention must be paid to the soundtrack. Hiroyuki Sawano has done an unbelievable job by composing an epic music, that makes your blood boil and your heartbeat frequency increase. The openings and endings are also something more than just mind blowing.

Characters are versatile and do reveal full spectrum of emotions as you see them suffering, dying, suffocating from the bottomless feelings they go through but still sacrificing their lives to reach the greater goal – TO BE FREE!

The degree of pleasure that I received from watching this anime is 150%. Something such incredible in every way, where each of its components suit more than perfectly and draw a picture of unknown beauty can be seen only once in a decade and I am very happy that I did not miss to see it.

Rating it 10/10 I call it an impeccable creation of the mastermind and best out of the best from what I've seen so far.",21,5,"May 3, 2017"

4,Season 1 is awesome. The rest is poop,"Season 1 was gritty.dark. gripping and genuinely had you interested for more.

Season 2 onwards is prrrrreeettttyyy bad. Got way too hard to follow and the whole show felt like a different show entirely after season 1. It got far too political and conveluded.

Suddenly the fact people could turn into titans was easily washed over. The whole thing needed revised in my opinion, story line filled with terrible hard to follow time skips. Total disaster and hard to watch.

With that being said DO make sure you watch season 1. Because that was awesome.

10,Slowly Became The Greatest Anime I've Ever Seen,"When I first watched Attack on Titan before it's 3rd Season had been released, I held it in pretty high regard; maybe on par with Death Note or FMA Brotherhood, if not slightly lower in quality. After watching the massive payoff rewarded to its viewers that is the 3rd Season, specifically Part 2, I've had a complete epiphany on just how amazing and well put together the story of this series really is.

Now, I personally consider this the greatest anime I've ever watched (as of today), if not one of the greatest series altogether. It's a shame that some people refuse to watch any anime at all, because they are seriously missing out on one of the greatest stories ever told in our generation's history.

If you were to re-watch this series every couple months, you would still be having your mind blown on the 8th viewing of the series, noticing things that you missed in previous viewings that make you look at the story or certain characters in a whole new light. I feel so bad for the Manga readers who either had the series spoiled for them online or simply just don't get to enjoy the story being told in the anime through god-tier voice acting.

I can't stress enough how good Attack on Titan's story, plot, & world building is. The reveal of the origin of the Titan's is something I've never seen before in movies, books, or series at this caliber of writing. If every show & story was this intricately created with a fine-toothed comb, every thriller/mystery show like Lost or even more liked shows like Stranger Things & Westworld would've turned out to be flawless masterpieces with the rare ability to over-deliver on the mystery box concept the stories had set up.

Where most series feel like the creators are just making the story up as they go along, AoT feels like the exact opposite where every little thing has been precisely thought out by Hajime Isayama & the other writers.

When a series can give serious emotional depth to something as simple as the name of it's first episode or the name of the series altogether that you won't even understand until the middle end of the series or on a second viewing, you know you're witnessing a true gem in storytelling.

Attack on Titan holds a respectable 8.8 on IMDB, but in my opinion, it should be even higher in the mid 9 range, though you would not think this until you've seen the entirety of Season 3 as I have. Not only because Season 3 is awe-inspiring, but because it gives new depth and meaning to nearly everything else in previous seasons & episodes; things you may have just thought were gratuitous giant monster battles then become meaningful events woven into a long bloody history & conflict with the Titans that become larger & more epic than the Colossal Titan itself.

If you love good writing, you need to put this at the top of your 'To Watch' list. If you are not a fan of Subbed anime, watch the Dubbed English version, which has superb voice acting as well.

10,I would have given this 7/10 in 2013 but after Season 3 my rating has changed,"The first season nailed animation, direction and visuals, but the storyline leaves much to be desired. Although there are plenty of shocking moments to capture your attention and leave you wanting for more, the plot is just not that complex. It is precisely what the title says: attack on titans. This season merely shows us a bunch of characters running around slaying Titans left and right while dropping dead right and left. Characterization is also mediocre. The three protagonists are quite one-dimensional, especially the main protagonist, Eren. It does set up the scene nicely, though, with developments that foreshadow a much deeper story. If anything, season 1 is a great example of tropes done right.

However, season 3 blows me away. The art, which is already amazing from the start, has actually improved, along with the visuals. The story becomes incredibly layered, and we see great character development for Eren and other recurring characters. The story suddenly deviates from generic shounen to arguably era-defining that describes humanity, freedom, and the price we must pay for it. Season 3 is a great example of genius writing. Episode 11's ending is an ""ah-ha"" moment where you realize everything ties in together and that the author must have planned everything from the start. SnK is a perfect balance between story and action. I hope Season 4 will not disappoint, but for now, this show gets 10/10 from me. Simply amazing.",13,2,"May 4, 2020"
10,the greatest story ever told,"2022 I was recommended the tv show Attack on titan not knowing how it would influence my life. Now that i have finished it my perspective of peace and freedom. And now with Attack on titan officially being over i think that it is safe to say that this is one the greatest stories ever told. I don't even think that that is an overstatement. This 100 episode series has you on the edge of your seat during your entire watch. I think that it is comical that people who haven't even seen attack on titan calls it a kids show. Attack on titan talks about topics like racism, sexism, depression, human trafficking and mass genocide, and I would not call that a kids show. I think you would be stupid not to give attack on titan a try. Even though it is animated it is one of the best stories ever told.",13,2,"Feb 26, 2024"

6,Incredibly overrated,"Maybe if this is the first ever anime you are seeing than it could be considered ""interesting"" or ""good""?

But it is OBJECTIVELY bad written and portrayed. It is watched only because of the main secrets which are being kept as such, but in a terrible way, and make no sense actually.

The episodes could actually be at least half the lenght, because they are filled with lenghty, useless and stupid dialogues that could be skipped.

Some important secrets are revealed in the most non-logical way, just like if the writer couldn't be able to find the better way.

You are not able to emotionally be attached to the characters, being many so stupid or worse, thus when something happens to them you couldn't care less.

Some scenes are portrayed like if they should be important while they aren't.

And so on.

Just don't lose your time like me and don't watch it, you don't really need to.",5,44,"Aug 13, 2023"
5,Anime spoils everything!,"So far, this show is just excellent. The Ost is potentially the best non-vocal score I've heard. It has a slow start. By which I mean it has fast pacing in episode, but not in the story, just too much action and shock value, not enough character development, and emotional/memorable character moments. Still really enjoyable, and does a great job at creating mystery.

It does provide consistent hooks that keep you watching at least, but by the end of Season 1 most of the characters feel pretty basic but are provided a decent setup into becoming more, and the show also beings to develop into a different tone.

Then we have season 2, which does a lot more (and I mean A LOT MORE) character development, and in my opinion, is where the show gets really really good. It develops what used to be, essentially background characters, makes all of them interesting, and then focuses on them. This makes the limited main cast of the first season change into a cast that is more broad and interesting. Every character of this larger cast then gets their own character development. These developments consistently deal with interesting themes and create compelling character moral dilemmas, all of which, are handled brilliantly and are given variety, through the amount of unique characters facing them.",6,37,"Jan 19, 2022"

I wonder at the Japanese how they brought out this masterpiece for us. It is an integrated work in every way. Aspects in terms of the unique idea, the plot, the development of the characters, the music, the feelings, and the relationships between the people, I say with all confidence that Disney will not reach the status of Japanese manga.",13,2,"Dec 31, 2023"

10,A Greek Tragedy in form of Anime,"I watched the whole series show in a couple weeks. And it was a thrilling ride. A remarkable story, very reminiscent of a Greek tragedy.

In the beginning you feel it is another Japanese kaiju action anime, but you quickly realize it is so much more than that.

It's beautifully animated, has great character development and deals with human nature. Mind you it is not a child friendly one, it deals with war and death and the meaning of it all, which is a lot for even a teenager to consume.

Each episode makes you want to watch the next one, and the next one and then the next... It is simply that good.

No season disappoints, no episode disappoints. It is truly a perfect 10!

10,A thoughtful analysis of 'Attack on Titan',"I am writing this review as the whole series of AOT rather than this particular series. Most people think that this anime series is about the actions and plots, well it is. However its more than that. I think its about the character named Eren Jaegar, who is bounded by a lot of diplomatic reasons to save humanity and at the end he did what is required to be done to save humanity from the mere humans. Even its meant to eradicate the 80% of the world population. The anime I have watched till this day, will be easily outranked by AOT. How the characters in the series have developed(or say written) is just amusing! Just watch this series with open mind, try not to make any favorites(at least till the series ends) and do not push yourself to understand thing by surfing through the internet, you will understand everything as the show progresses. Be calm and binge watch it.",13,2,"Mar 9, 2024"
10,Best show i love it,"Oh my god, this anime is apsolitely stunning. It has perfect fights, perfect animation, perfect story, everything, i love it. Eren is absolute god he is very good character. For begineer in anime or even pro, this anime is very good option, it is my personal favourite anime, it is just perfect, just watch it yourself. In this anime is a lot of very good plot twists and i love how you slowly thru the show discover the truth. The WIT studio and the Mappa did very good job, the animation is just perfect. The character development in this show is just stunning, how you see at the beggining a group of innocent children and at the you see what became of them.",13,2,"Sep 5, 2022"
10,"Prepare for one hellll of a ride for not just the best anime, but one of the best shows in TV history !!","Oh mannn.... if you haven't watched this show yet and planning to watch it for the first time, I envy you because this show right here is the best work of art ever produced, not just in anime industry, but in the history of TV. Having watched amazing movies and series, its really not an exaggeration to say this that Attack on Titan is easily above bar with Game of Thrones and on par with Breaking Bad. The show primarily is focused on the struggle of humanity against giant man-eating titans, but trust me it has a lot more to offer, depicting the elements of human behaviour and strong emotions in both peaceful and adverse situations: friendship, betrayal, love, humour, enmity, leadership, compliance, battle tactics, sacrifice; it has literally everything. The animations are breathtaking, the soundtrack is magnificent, the pace of the story is perfect, plus the best part is the writing and storytelling which is top-notch that one can only admire and praise. The characters including both major and minor ones are so well written and portrayed, and their character development as well as the series progress is also commendable and awe inspiring such that people simply care about them all. The amount of foreshadowing in this show makes one wonder if the writer has prepared the ending well before writing the beginning.

To conclude, this majestic piece of art has surpassed every bit of expectations, and this timeless masterpiece is a must watch for everyone and for all people of all ages and regions.",23,6,"Jun 26, 2021"

6,Masterpiece with an unfortunate ending,"Attack on Titan is without a doubt one of the most thrilling and complex anime series ever created. From its gripping start, filled with jaw-dropping twists and intense action, to its intricate world-building and morally grey characters, the show masterfully keeps you on the edge of your seat. The themes of freedom, survival, and the cyclical nature of violence are explored with such depth that it leaves a lasting impact long after the credits roll. The characters evolve in profound and often shocking ways, with the main cast leading the charge in one of anime's most compelling narratives. Each season builds upon the last with perfectly timed plot twists, raising the stakes while pulling you deeper into the mysteries of the Titans, the history of Paradis Island, and the complex politics at play. The animation, particularly in the later seasons, is stunning, and the soundtrack is nothing short of iconic.

However, as incredible as the journey is, the ending leaves much to be desired. After all the buildup, emotional investment, and philosophical questions posed throughout the series, the conclusion feels rushed and underwhelming. The final arc makes some questionable narrative choices that undermine the complexity of the characters and themes that were carefully developed over time. It's hard not to feel disappointed when such a masterpiece delivers a finale that feels disjointed and unsatisfying, especially after the series had set the bar so high in the first 3 seasons.",2,12,"Oct 20, 2024"

A very well crafted masterpiece. Why? Because it decieves you into thinking that this is just another ""super hero"" show with some titans etc,it really questions your decision of watching it if you are not an anime fan in few occasions,because it complicates things more and more,it is all for a reason of course,but people with small attention span might catch themselves in these moments getting bored because they got used to squid game pacing etc,just keep going forward trust me. That is the magic of it,because it easily became the best thing I have ever watched and I will have trouble finding something interesting after this show. BUT patience is the key for the viewers who watch it for the first time and are not anime fans. Just watch it,you have no idea what you are missing! In my opinion this show lifted the standards,not just for anime,but for TV series aswell,just like BB did when it came out. Now the AoT did the same thing. I will wait for the next new show which will do it,but this show is really untill now the nearest thing to PERFECTION,an inch or two in front of Breaking Bad IMO(even though I consider BB also a masterpiece)it is just too bad that people avoid it because it is anime.

While the show is not perfect, it does do a phenomenal job of telling the story of the characters in the world. The destruction going on in the world they created in shown clearly. It shows from almost every perspective just how ugly war is on all sides. Attack on Titan has its slow moments and its easy to understand where some may get there doubts, yet it should be clear to all that Attack on Titan masterfully portrays the gross events of war.",6,0,"Jul 1, 2024"
10,Completely honest review,"This show is absolutely fantastic. I had fun watching it the whole way through but season 3 and season 4 are on whole other league of story telling. That isn't an exaggeration. To anyone that dropped the show in season 1 or 2 I feel bad for you. Because you just missed out on the greatest piece of story telling EVER. To anyone starting anime I recommend you to NOT watch this as your first anime. Because your expectations will be so high that you will be disappointed that other anime's don't reach that same level attack on titan did.

This anime should 100% not be recommended to the younger audience's though. This show is heavy on gore and violence but that doesn't subtract any fun away from the show. But for anyone older the age of 17 there is no way you wouldn't like this show.

It's difficult to get through, the plot is terrible, there is nothing to root for, and it undermines the first 3 seasons and everything that made them great.

10,Finally a good anime,"Attack on Titan might the only anime which i can recommend to any non anime fan without getting embarrassed. It's just so different and unique compared to any other anime I've ever seen which has actually great writting. Attack on Titan is considered one of the greatest anime for several reasons, primarily due to its compelling storytelling, complex themes, and exceptional execution across multiple fronts. Here are some key factors:

1.

10,THE GREATEST ANIME KNOWN TO MANKIND,"The best I have ever watched undoubtedly. It sets the peak of fiction and I feel it is the best Tv Series ever to be made. Filled with plot twists nothing is what it seems in AOT. Being the most popular anime and the highest rated anime on IMDB it surely fits into two boxes than shows are seldom able to fit in being both a mass entertainer and being critically acclaimed. The characters are very good especially Levi, Hange and Armin. The main character gets insane character development in S4. The first two seasons are not perfect but s3 and s4 are probably the best anime has got to provide. The action scenes are insane too. The opening songs are good and the background music is crazy. This is probably the best anime that will ever exist. Even though, the ending is criticised I personally feel the anime perfected the ending of this true masterpiece. It is still the most popular anime on Imdb even though it has been 1 year since its release date.",6,0,"Oct 7, 2024"
10,Absolute Masterpiece,I've seen a bunch of animes. I've thought I've seen it all. Well I was wrong. Attack On Titan is the best series you will ever see. If I could erase a series out of my mind it would be Attack on Titan no question. The CGI is a bit funky at times but the story is immaculate. I've never felt such goosebumps in my life before. I'm currently rewatching this anime with my family and well we're all enjoying it. This series has countless plottwists you'd never see coming. The Music is also top notch. It hits like a truck every time. You should definitely give this amazing anime a try. Have fun watching!,6,0,"Jul 18, 2024"

The horror is heart wrenching but you can't look away. The characters are very complex. And it accurately describes what war is like. I just, I'll never not have a deep sadness when it comes to this show. And to some that may drive them away. But all in all it is unlike and tv show I have ever seen and think will see.

6,Mediocre,"Although AOT has many strengths such as interesting character development, beautiful art and a stable storyline, the whole series feels a bit off.

The story is so focused on ensuring that it's a tragedy that many things are just unrealistic, including loopholes in the plot when analysing further.

Some parts are rushed and some parts are very slow-paced, I skipped half of the second season and the third was best by far.

The 4th season took on a completely different aesthetic from the rest, you won't get to see more than 10 minutes of the main characters until something like episode 4. Although some may argue that it's vital for the storyline I'd argue that there should be a balance and introducing completely new characters is a dangerous game especially when they become main focus.

I know the animators had to follow the manga but still...just a bit disappointing.",6,76,"Jan 7, 2021"
5,Disappointing but still good,"I started watching this anime back in 2013. The soundtrack and visuals were breathtaking, but what got me hooked was its shocking cruelty and fatalism, something hard to find in the shounen (young male) demographic.

The story showed a world full of mysteries, in which friendship and willpower would not be enough for the characters to overcome their difficulties. The fantastic elements allowed epic battle scenes, but there were restrictions to the power scale that gave the feeling about a more thoughtful world-building in which unreasonably powerful characters, quite common in shounen, were not possible.

As the story goes on, many of the mysteries are explained, keeping the viewers hooked, waiting for more to be revealed.

As any other story, it had its ups and downs. However, it started losing its charm after the main breaking point. To make things worse, the studio that adapted the last story arcs didn't do a great job. The animation quality wasn't good, not even for the studio's standards. It lacked details, like textures and a good lighting. The production was rushed.

Nonetheless, that's not the main issue, but the deficient storytelling of the final arcs. The main characters lacked development, contrasting with greatly developed secondary characters. The drastic personality changes experienced by the protagonist were molded according to the events in order to justify them, instead of the other way around. That is, the changes were forced. The author missed his chance to deepen into the psychology of the protagonist.

The story also started falling into the most common shounen clichés, going far enough to break all the rules and logic set during the beginning: plot armours, deus ex machina (more precisely, enemy ex machina), illogically powerful enemies, loose ends and disappointing lore explanations with the addition of an attempt to introduce some symbolism to it. In other words, the author chose to take the easy way out of the labyrinth he built. The final events aren't the issue, but the way they were reached. It was like watching a racing car reach the finishing line completely out of control.

No matter how hard it tried to avoid being the stereotypical shounen happy end, it still failed.",5,30,"Mar 26, 2024"

10,"""Why Attack on Titan is a Must-Watch Masterpiece""","Attack on Titan is hands-down one of the best things in fiction today. The show kicks off with an incredible concept-humans battling giant, man-eating monsters-and keeps raising the stakes with jaw-dropping action and plot twists. The characters are deep and the animation is top-tier, making every episode a thrill ride. If you're into stories that are intense, gripping, and simply unforgettable, Attack on Titan is an absolute must-watch. You won't regret it!

What makes Attack on Titan truly stand out is its ability to blend complex themes with its high-octane narrative. The show doesn't just rely on its breathtaking action sequences; it delves into profound questions about freedom, survival, and the nature of humanity. The political intrigue and moral ambiguity add layers of depth, challenging viewers to think critically about the world within the show and our own.

Moreover, the character development throughout the series is exceptional. Characters evolve in unexpected ways, and their personal journeys are as compelling as the overarching plot. This emotional investment keeps you on the edge of your seat, making each twist and turn even more impactful.

The soundtrack also deserves a mention. The powerful score amplifies the tension and drama, enhancing the overall viewing experience. With its gripping storytelling, well-crafted characters, and stunning visuals, Attack on Titan is a triumph of modern anime that offers something for everyone, whether you're a long-time fan of the genre or new to it.",6,0,"Jul 31, 2024"

I still think about this show almost every day and it has been a year since I first watched it.

After rewatching, I could truly experience all of the details Isayama added, the foreshadowing is absolutely brilliant and nothing comes close to it.

The ending is perfect in my opinion, even though we all wished and hoped for a different one, but the one we got was the only possible choice for the characters to end up.

I would recommend this to anyone and truly think this is masterpiece everyone deserves to enjoy in their lives.

I don't even know where to start, but I think it's the only anime I fell in love with from the first 4 minutes of watching it and I simply developed an obsession for everything that means Attack on titan! I've heard this anime talked about all the time, how it's really good, but my expectations were far exceeded. It's simply on another level, it's a masterpiece from the first to the last episode! I can't even categorize it as the best anime, but the best show I've ever seen and I'm really one of those people who doesn't miss anything, or any good movie, series or anime. Everything I watched after aot seemed to me nothing compared to this masterpiece. It will be very hard to find anything good after watching this show, I assure you. I don't think I'll ever find something I like as much as Aot. It's been 6 months since I finished it and I still haven't recovered. Every day I look for videos with Aot, I listen to the music from Aot, I make comparisons and in my head there is only Attack on titan. The story is unique and taken to the extreme, everything is so unexpected, intense and well-defined that I have no words. The characters are fantastic, absolutely each one has its own charm, but for me, Eren stayed in my soul forever. The music is exceptional, you even get goosebumps at some moments. The writer is a genius and I thank God for creating such wonder and sharing it with us. Whoever doesn't agree with the ending and says it's weak, means he didn't really understand the story, because the ending is magnificent and it's exactly as it should be! I cried a lot and I still suffer from some painful memories because I got very attached to this series, but with my hand on my heart I heartily recommend you watch Attack on titan because you won't regret it!

5,"Beautiful and bold, but boring and bombastic","There's a lot to like here, particularly the large cast of well conceived, developed and believable character. The background art - which is often the only art - is splendid, and the score and sound effects are solid.

The concept and plot - initially - are top notch, and the titans themselves are horrifically grotesque. The first few episodes are packed with worldbuilding, character building, and impactful action.

However, by half way through the first season, it all starts to drag and episodes become woefully stretched out. The 24 minute runtime is bookended by such long ""previously on / next on"" and credits song that I counted as little as 15 minutes of fresh content per episode.

And within that content, far, far, far too much of it is repeated speeches, still art, repeated speeches, exposition, repeated speeches, flashbacks, repeated speeches and flashbacks WITHIN flashbacks. Yes, that actually happens, more than once.

Some episodes cover a few seconds of time, and I mean literally a few seconds, with a few brief actions buried under a mound of anguished dialogue and soul-searching.

It rapidly becomes a chore to progress though it, skipping ahead to find any action or a gritty, determined speech that hasn't already been delivered a dozen or more times already.

And by the end of the final season, the plot simply falls apart as the writers just give up and cop out with gibberish and nonsensical babbling.

Ultimately it's a series that promises so much, yet ultimately delivers so little over so long a time that I can't recommend it.",4,23,"Jun 4, 2024"

10,A Masterpiece of Modern Anime - AOT Redefines the Genre,"Attack on Titan is nothing short of a masterpiece, a monumental achievement in storytelling, animation, and emotional depth. From the very first episode, it grips you with its intense action, unpredictable plot twists, and a hauntingly beautiful score. The series seamlessly blends elements of horror, fantasy, and political intrigue, creating a world that's both terrifying and captivating. The characters are richly developed, each with their own complexities and motivations that drive the narrative forward. Eren, Mikasa, Armin, and Levi, among others, evolve in ways that are both tragic and inspiring, making you care deeply about their fates.

The animation quality is top-notch, especially in the later seasons, where the battles against Titans are depicted with breathtaking fluidity and detail. The themes of freedom, sacrifice, and the cycle of violence are explored with a maturity rarely seen in anime, challenging the viewer to question their own perspectives. Every episode leaves you on the edge of your seat, eagerly anticipating what comes next.

Attack on Titan isn't just an anime; it's a cultural phenomenon that will be remembered for years to come.

10,A series that continually gets better with every season.,"In 2013, season one of this anime aired - and everybody was going nuts. 25 episodes of nonstop action filled with plot twists, revelations, amazing animation and OST. People who had never watched anime in their life gave this a try because it was so popular. Which character would die next? Who is the identity of this titan? Everybody was talking about it!

And so came the hiatus. Four years of letting the same 25 episodes sit within the community. And, as time went on, people liked it less, and started to pick it apart, speaking of weak characterization and a nonsensical plot. Let anything sit that long, people will get bored of it, and rightfully so. The hype died down during the hiatus and when season 2 aired it was barely managing to hold its ground against the fresh My Hero Academia.

But this series tops itself with each passing arc by a longshot. Season two solved the characterization problems season 1 had and included even BETTER revelations, BETTER plot twists, and set key plot points into motion that affect the rest of the series. 2x6 is arguably the best episode of the show so far.

And then came season 3! A change in tone, but for the better - things got complicated here. And boy was it wonderful. It might as well have been a completely different show than what was shown in season one, but it is one and the same - because that's what this show does. It grows. It changes. It evolves into something greater with each episode, as mysteries are solved and new questions are posed. The simple yet unique concept that was shown in the first episode is expanded upon in unimaginable ways.

The first episode was incredible, but the pacing in the first season seemed slow, and i took a bit for me to get into it. With only one episode left now i understand why it was paced the way it was. I cannot think of a single other piece of fiction that has been written with as much care and attention to detail as attack on titan has been. I don't think there are any words i can say to truly encapsulate the way this masterpiece makes me feel. From start to finish, everything has been intentional.

10,THE MOST AMAZING MASTERPIECE I'VE WITNESSED,"EVERYONE NEEDS TO WATCH THIS MASTERPIECE!!!

I put this series off for soooooo long because I was scared of the titans when they came out (facepalm to my younger self). But since a friend of mine plus people in the internet raved about it I gave a third shot. It is easily one of the greatest shows I've watched in my life and probably the best anime. What makes the anime special is pretty much EVERYTHING. From the way they tell the story of humanity as each character discovers more about the mystery surrounding them to how they built the characters and make you so attached to them. I found myself caring about each character, not only the main characters but the secondaries as well. It touches on so many important topics about humanity: religion, racism, war, freedom, death, you name it! I got goosebumps on many scenes. It really makes you think and reflect.

You should watch this to understand how is it possible to not expect the final. You wait for something good in every second of every episodes but you feel pain and sorrow with the characters at the same time.

""little-girl-who's-probably-not-even-13-yet-is-able-to-easily-kill-a-man-without-breaking-down-and-freaking-out-bc-he-killed-her-parents"" cliche. Another con: Bryce Papenbrook. I'm so sorry, I absolutely HATE actor-shaming but I have seen him voice so many teenagers with edgy-issues (Shirou Emiya, Kirito, Eren, etc...) that it now makes my ears bleed. Half of his lines are SCREAMING that ""I will kill all the titans! I'm ten ft tall even tho im rlly like 5'7, lmao!!"" The english dub is OK. that's it. If you want a good english dub, see Fate/Zero.

Here are some good things: The !! Directing !! Is !! Beautiful !! The concept is wonderfully amazing and fulfilling! I love post-apocalyptic plots! Most of the characters are tolerable, if not lovable. Comedic moments are well placed and paced. They don't pop in at random moments like in other anime's (SAO, Naruto, Fate/Stay Night...) The animation is surprisingly good! I love it and its beautiful. THE GORE IS SURPRISINGLY GORE-Y WITHOUT BEING COMPLETELY GROSS AND GROTESQUE (with that being said, I would be fine if they showed some eyeballs and internal organs, lol. Corpse Party had me wanting more.) YES ALSO THE SOUNDTRACK IS THE /BEST/ thanks for coming to my ted talk bye bye",4,58,"Sep 20, 2018"

10,Once you get hooked there is no filler for your escape,"It's been two days since I completed Naruto Shippuden and I desperately wanted to start another interesting anime. I have a long list of anime and I wanted to start something special but I didn't know what to watch. After some thinking, I started Boruto, yeah I sure did, but I got bored because it's a little slow and we all know that Naruto filled with lots of fillers. Somehow I recalled that I wanted to start AoT so, I thought to give it a try. And after watching the pilot episode, I knew that this went beyond my expectation. And after 6 episodes, I became one of my favorite animes. The anime is all serious, not a single second of a fun element, which I like very much. And with the theme of the military, fighting with giant titans and countless sacrifices makes it full of sadness. Another amazing thing is the visual graphics which is simply stunning and capture every single expression of a character flawlessly. The soundtrack is amazing and with every intense scene, it becomes intense too. What I like the most is that none of the episodes are worthless. Once you get hooked there is no filler for your escape. In a single day, I completed the first season. Then I checked and found that the recent season just completed and people are praising it so much. Currently, I am about to start the second season but one thing I know is that the journey ahead will surely be something my mind hasn't comprehend yet.

7,i got into it quite quickly,This anime is in my top 10 out of like over 70 i have seen. The story line of this is very good with interesting characters such as Eren i found him more interesting then the others (you'll understand why when you watch it.) i also like what they did with the titans as i'm pretty sure they got the idea from like zombies but zombies can get boring as they are easy to kill but with titans there harder to kill and people are more feared of them then anything. I'm still waiting for season two of this but its taking quite a while and have been putting it off for some time (if you have already seen this you will understand the pain of waiting lol) there's not really anything else i can say about this as its hard to describe without spoiling it but i do highly recommend you watch this!,2,22,"Oct 13, 2016"
2,Lost interest on all anime after watching this anime,"This anime don't deserve this much hype.i Lost all interest on all anime after watching this anime.it has very low action,romance, emotional scenes overall very low on spices and especially no comedy scenes.waste of time, storage and data.if you still want to watch you can watch it.",19,208,"Aug 30, 2021"
10,To put it simply AoT has become in the legendary category of masterpiece,"Whenever I watch a show I ask myself how much time did I waste watching this and what did I learn? The critical thinking and thought process of this show has me astounded. The show simply does not skip a beat throughout. The pacing, the action, the philosophy, and the sheer cruelty of this show has reminded me of how beautiful and cruel life can be. Most shows can rarely achieve this let alone an animated one.

For those who just have a unquenchable thirst for curiosity this show will have you hooked. Season 1 has some deep philosophy but it is mostly cruel and filled with black and white viewpoints, this is turn makes a lot of people kind of give up on the show a little premature except for those who are curious as they will soon be rewarded. Season 2 the black and white story starts turning a little more grey yet the action and pace is only cranked up higher with the philosophical insight to things is ever growing. Season 3 is the season which places this entire show in the category of masterpiece. It is the season where everything has become grey. You do not know who to side with and you can only pity both sides. As the shows theme echos how cruel the world is this season emphasizes that meaning to a whole new level. Not only that the depth of the characters you get from the start of the season which seemed to be pretty simple and basic have become so complex. You really see a childish attitude in some of these characters change so rapidly as you progress.

The show has become one of my all time favorites among Band of Brothers, Breaking bad, The Wire, and GoT (albeit the last two seasons may have ruined GoT from being the complete masterpiece it deserved to be).

Attack on Titan is not just a work of art it is a masterpiece of storytelling regardless if it is fiction and animated as most of its philosophy translates to the real world.",12,2,"Jul 16, 2019"
10,Isayama deserves a Nobel Prize,"I think he is one of the greatest storytellers in history for this. This is amazing beyond belief. Not only the story though, the animation and voice acting is done so well too to culminate into this beautiful masterpiece.",17,4,"Feb 6, 2021"
10,Best Anime ever Made .And SEASON 3 PART 2 will break all records just wait,Greatest Gift to Human kind from Anime. This anime will be Epic,17,4,"Jun 24, 2019"
10,The best story fiction has ever seen.,"I'm someone who has watched, read, and played a lot of different pieces of media. I've read a lot of books and comics, played a lot of storydriven games, watched a lot of movies and tv-shows, both live action and animated, but Attack on Titan has by far the best story of them all.

I'm of the opinion that Attack on Titan actually deserves to be Nr1 on IMDB. In this spoiler free review I will be trying to explain as to why this is the case.

Premise:

100 years ago humanity created massive walls to hide and protect themselves from titans. Titans are humanoid creatures that feast on human beings. They show no interest in other living beings and live with the sole desire to eat humans.

Character-driven plot:

Attack on Titan does an amazing job at letting the characters drive the story forward. How characters react to certain events and how the world they live in changes them as a person is done in an outstanding way. The world feels extremely realistic with political, social, cultural, and economical structures. Every human being has their own way of thinking and they influence the world by taking actions according to their own ideology. You can actually understand every character as to why they behave the way they do. The past is what shapes them into who they are in the present and shapes the course of their future, and the present is what can potentially change said course.

Story:

It's story is in my opinion on another level compared to any other story. The main reason is as to why is how it's constructed and told. Isayama, the creator of AoT, perfectly knew how his story was going play out from the very start. Every single episode is full of foreshadowing and references to things you would only understand after rewatching it. This is not a spoiler since Isayama blends it seemlessly within his story, but after rewatching it, everything starts to become clear. You look at every scene and every character in a completely different way because you actually know what will happen later on in the story. Rewatching this show at least once is actually a must to completely understand the show due to its complexity.

Attack on Titan is one of the most thought-provoking shows out there (especially in the later seasons). They make you question your own way of thinking and how to look at both the AoT world and our own. The profound philosophical themes they use in the later seasons is one of the main reasons as to why I consider it to be the current best piece of media.

Attack on Titan is also a master at exceeding your expectations. They will set up the story in a way so that you have certain expectations of what will happen next, but then AoT flips the story on its head with a massive plot-twist. These plot-twists are always done in a perfect way and don't feel like cop-outs.

Its ending:

So the ending of AoT is considered to be quite controversial. People either hate or love it. Imo it's a perfect ending for as to what the show is trying to convey.

Is it the best ending of all time? No, but it's a perfect ending for Attack on Titan.

After hearing the arguments the haters gave as to why the ending is bad, I realized that the haters just didn't understand the story of AoT at all. They had a completely wrong understanding of what it tried to convey. My guess is that those people are under the age of 18 with a less developed brain, or they aren't one of the brightest out there.

Animation, Direction, and Cinematography:

Attack on Titan is one of the visually most stunning anime out there.

The first 3 seasons are done by Wit Studio. They are famous for using camera angles really well during fight scenes. It really helps to immerse yourself into the world.

Mappa took over the project starting from the Final Season. With the first part of the final season they had some animation issues due to time restrictions, but from Part 2 onward its quality skyrocketed. It felt like you were watching a movie in the cinemas.

Music:

Wow, actually wow... Hands down one of the best and most epic OSTs ever created. It's done by Hiroyuki Sawano, the most famous and most popular composer in the anime industry. The music plays a massive role in the show. Sawano is one of the few who can actually make OSTs which blend in with the show perfectly. You could call him the Hans Zimmer for anime (he has a completely different style tho).

The only ""downside"" to AoT:

The only ""downside"" AoT has is that its first seasons are not a masterpiece when you watch it for the first time, but those seasons turn into masterpieces after finishing the show and rewatching them. Some people would say they liked the first season, but it wasn't the masterpiece they expected it to be. I also completely agree with said statement. Back in 2013, when I first started to watch Attack on Titan, I enjoyed it a lot, but didn't think it was one of the best shows at all. When Season 3 Part 2 was airing, that's when I started to realize I was witnessing a masterpiece in the making.

Isayama was waiting for the water to boil before he started cooking, but he knew exactly how he was going to cook from the very start.

Conclusion:

Just go a watch it.",9,1,"Jul 21, 2024"

10,"NO WORDS, SIMPLY AMAZING","((Review without spoilers)) Attack on Titan, what can I say about this anime? A masterpiece that will be difficult to surpass or achieve for a long period of time. Attack on Titan teaches us a variety of things that we can learn, from politics, love, friendship, relationships in general, it shows us different paths in which life can leave us, it shows that decision-making is fundamental in our lives, where we have We need to be careful with our choices, Attack on Titan is an audiovisual masterpiece, its impactful soundtracks, which make us much more immersive in the anime, every detail that the workers put into the anime, every countenance, every look, you realize that Each character is unique and does not follow a standard like many animes. And I think that's why Attack on Titan is so loved by the public, because it's unique, at first you might even think it's just another shounen anime in which the protagonist starts out weak and because of something external he gains motivation to defeat the villain. Attack on Titan manages to be completely the opposite of that, so many plots, so many motivations that you get to the point of thinking that the anime doesn't have a protagonist. Speaking of the protagonist, Eren Jeager, what a character, what a well-written story, a character that at first you love, then you start to hate him and finally you love him again because you understand his motivations, which for many he can be considered an asshole, but you know that deep down he's not like that. And not just Eren, but all the other characters that in other animes would be ""forgotten"" in Attack on Titan, no, they have their past, they have their own story, and that's what makes you have affection for them. And as you can see, at no point did I talk about the titans themselves, even though they are extremely important, you can see that the anime is not just focused on a bunch of titans fighting each other. Attack on Titan encompasses the family, encompasses the love we have for those who have always been there for us, who, despite their different decisions, will never stop loving them. Attack on Titan encompasses both an incredible journey through time and a simple life of a character that would otherwise be forgotten. Attack on Titan has become my favorite anime, because of these little things I said, I'm not taking it personally. Because Attack on Titan is without a doubt an art. If someone recommends Attack on Titan, don't think twice, watch it and then thank them. And that's it, thank you very much for taking the time to read this review.

As: of a Brazilian guy for: to the world.",9,1,"Jan 23, 2024"
9,Really Good,"Its one of the most popular anime and it won't be surprising once you start watching it. Long before I watched attack on titan I would see clips and banners everywhere which really intrigued me. Once I did watch it, it was an overwhelming experience the concept of titans is fascinating, and it sure is a classic and definite recommendation.",9,1,"Feb 4, 2021"
6,Not bad Not impressive enough,"For me that is not really a die hard fans of the series,I thought the movie is quite decent. It is not that bad actually if you come with your memory loss of any anime plots trace and just enjoy the movie as it is. For me though, the lack part is that the movie looks like it has rushed too much (only 1 hour and half). I mean no decent training part?come on. Moreover,something that bothers is that most of the army squad members seem untrained aka normal people without proper training that are just kicked outside the world to try their luck. Actors wise, I personally like Armin and the girl in spectacles the best. Eren,not so much. Mikasa? Not that entranced. I still hope and hope that nothing will happen between them. They are better off as best friend. Like Harry Potter and Hermione? Ya know? I look forward to the part 2 to conclude this movie. The ending of part 1 is quite bad though, like it does not really give deep impression. But oh well, NEXT!",3,47,"Aug 23, 2015"

9,A Thrilling Ride!,This show offers so much. There's a lot of action and thrills. Along with some frightening and sad moments. Honestly at times it kinda reminds me of Game of Thrones or the walking dead. Because you never really know who's gonna die. The story is really good and it has really developed throughout the four seasons. Theirs lots of characters to like and dislike. Their designs all look great and the back drop with the cities and landscape looks beautiful. The only thing for me is that there's a few parts in the story and some character mood changes that I just don't really appreciate. But it's just about a perfect 10. Thus why I give it a 9. Honestly I believe this show will be in my top 5 anime. But that's my opinion...,9,1,"Feb 14, 2021"
10,I have never been more satisfied with an ending!,"I'm going to start with saying thank you to Tetsuro Araki and Hajime Isayama for creating this masterpiece. I have never started an anime with so many questions and theories from episode 1 all the way down to the last 2 movies. Eren Yeager is definitely my favorite character in Anime history and might be my favorite character in entertainment. I never thought it would get to this point and the journey we went on with him and his friends to discover the truth of everything was so insane it had me leaping off the couch because I thought I had everything figured out each season, but noooooo there was more to the secret of the titans and royalty over and over again which blew my mind even more. Unbelievable ending and unbelievable story. Thank you so much and hope for another project similar in the future.",9,1,"May 29, 2024"

9,An amazing experience that will not be repeated,"I can't find words that can express what I feel. This show is one of the best I have ever seen on screen. We lived a long journey with the characters and their development. All the characters are written in a very high quality, and many of them are mostly gray, so you cannot hate them, especially after presenting their motives. You will understand their actions. The animation is great, the fights, and the design of the world as a whole are amazingly well done. Also, the music is a piece of art that will remain stuck in my mind forever. As for the vocal performances, they are beyond excellent, a piece of art. This show is amazing and wonderful, and my rating for it would have been 10/10 if it had not been for the ending and the character of Ymir, which I did not accept or accept her motives, and it is considered the biggest mystery for me in this work as a whole. In general, I enjoyed this show a lot, and I was emotionally affected, and I also cried many times while watching it, and I advise anyone who has not watched it to watch it because it is worth it, but you must be careful with your eyes and your heart. A wonderful experience that will remain in my memory as one of the best things I have ever seen in my life.",9,1,"Mar 3, 2024"
10,Should be 10/10,"In all honesty, I've never really liked anime, but then my son made me watch Jujitu Kaisen and was absolutely hooked. He then said you need to watch attack on titan straight away, So I did.. 3 weeks later after I was completely obsessed with it...

I've never seen such an amazing (anything) in my life! It's now my favourite thing ever, over any film or TV show!! If you haven't watched it - DO IT NOW.!!!! Honestly watch it now!!

The soundtrack, is also outstanding, and the whole show deserves even 10/10

You will not regret's it at all, as will be watching all again in the next month or so!

6,Overrated but still...,No content,3,49,"Jan 21, 2015"
1,It was very promising but...,"It was very promising but the writer stretched it too much. As a result it kept repeating it self in terms of moral dilemmas of the characters, introducing new characters that didn't really offer anything new but just experienced the same anguishes from a different point of view, only to be repeated again and again and again.

Also the development of certain characters was non consistent ( such as Armin's which had evolved greatly in the first 3 seasons only to be diminished into an imbecile in the 4 season or Jean) or non existent (such as Mikasa). It's also very bad to have a story where your protagonist is a total unlikeable brat that only makes it through thanks to the effort of others.

Many of the characters have were inexplicably idiotic in many situations especially given the fact that they were living under constant duress.

The anti-war, anti-prejudice, anti-racism, anti- colonialism, anti-genocide messages with direct references to wwI and wwII are all well and good, but ultimately are not enough to compensate for the anticlimactic ending and convoluted plot.

It meant well but ultimately tried too hard and missed it's mark.

The character development is also amazing and the whole plot makes you think that a great mind is behind of all the seires writing.

7,Overrated,"Just because every one says it's great doesn't mean it's good. Attack on titan has general anime flaws that prevent it from beaning a masterpiece that everyone thinks it is.

The main problem is that Attack on titan feels like 2 movies chopped up into 25 episodes. Most episodes don't stand up on their own because it feels like your just watching a random chunk out of a movie which results in the episodes feeling out of context.

Character wise, Attack on titan only develops the main characters. Everyone else is bland and forgettable.

This Anime isn't all bad however. Attack on titan is good at building tension. it's about the same level of tension as shown in the hunger games movies. Attack on titan also has very little fan- service moments which makes it less pandering and unwatchable.

Attack on titan is generally good but it's very forgettable.",3,50,"Jan 15, 2017"

10,The Greatest Anime Series of all time,"This is by far The Greatest Anime Series of all time. The story, the characters, the soundtrack, the suspense, the animation everything is top notch in this anime. The complex writing of the character Eren Yeager is one of the best. Here are some reasons why AoT is one of the greatest anime of all time. Powerful female characters like Mikasa Ackerman who is considered one of the strongest characters in the series. No unnecessary filler episodes or arcs their Bold and daring plot twists also power system is mysterious and powerful.

10,PEAK FICTION & ABSOLUTE CINEMA,"Attack on Titan: The Masterpiece of Writing and Storytelling.

The writing of Attack on Titan is unbelievably strong. Every opening and ending is heartwarming, dramatic, and of the highest quality. With Amazing Breathtaking actions, smooth animation, a masterfully written story, and unforgettable characters, this show has everything in abundance. The Emotional depth, Unique Plot, Twisted Plot Twists, and captivating music make it a peak anime experience. Every character is lovable and respectable (well, except King Fritz).

Each season outdoes the last, culminating in one of the greatest stories ever told.

Season 1 (🔥) sets the stage with 25 episodes, covering the Fall of Shiganshina District, Humanity's Comeback, the Battle of Trost District, and the Female Titan arcs. This season introduces brave Eren, strong Mikasa, and intelligent Armin, making them feel like family. The foreshadowing and attention to detail are top-notch, even this early on. It brilliantly portrays the fear and humanity of soldiers facing death.

Favorite episodes: 1, 5, 8, 13, 17, 21, 22, and 25.

Season 2 (🔥🔥) has only 12 episodes but surpasses the first season with improved animation, deeper storylines, and incredible character development. The Clash of the Titans arc is intense, emotional, and full of twists.

Favorite episodes: 26, 27, 29, 30, 31, 36, and 37.

Season 3 (🔥🔥🔥) spans 22 episodes, covering the Royal Government arc and One of the Greatest Arc of the Anime History The Legendary Return to Shiganshina District Arc. This season changes everything, revealing Grisha's basement and reshaping the plot and genre of the series. The action, story, and music hit unparalleled heights, making this a defining season in anime history.

There are countless favorite scenes, and every episode feels like a masterpiece. Wit Studio will always be remembered for this.

Season 4 (🔥🔥🔥🔥) includes 28 episodes and 2 specials, featuring One of the Greatest Arc of the Anime History - Marley Arc and War for Paradis Arc. It's hard to put into words how phenomenal this season is. Impossible to choose my favourite episodes. Mappa Studio did an incredible job, and every single episode deserves a 9+ rating.

I have no complaints about the ending; I enjoyed it and deeply respect Hajime Isayama's conclusion.

Eren Yeager is easily in my top 3 favorite anime characters, though his actions were morally complex. I will always remember this show until my last breath.

The music, from ""Akuma no Ko"" to ""Barricades"" and ""Vogel im Käfig"" , ""T-KT"", ""Call of Silence"", ""Sasageyo"" now feels nostalgic. Just six months after starting the series, I already feel a longing to relive it.

7,"Great for the first 2.5 seasons, downhill after.","Unfortunately this show feels like the ""Saint Seiya"" of the new generation in the sense that it was innovative for it's time but unfortunately like Saint Seiya after the power 1, there is a power 2, then a hidden power 3, then one that nobody knew of power 4 and so on, it gets boring and no longer follows the physics of the anime and instead its science fiction of science fiction.

At this point as I watched season 4 part 2 I had hoped they would end it but I found more of the same non sense and unfortunately I have to leave it alone at this point as it is no longer entertaining because they keep coming up with new impossibilities.

The first season alone I would have rated 10, season 4-2 a solid 4.

7 Average I think, hopefully they will end it on the next and not go the path of the Walking dead where it was extended just because there was nothing else to produce.",2,27,"May 10, 2023"
1,Whatever needed to happen happened.,"I honestly had high hopes for this anime, but unfortunately after season 2 and 3 for some, the story and writing plummeted. All of it became foreshadowing where I guessed everything that happened before it happened. The writers seemed to become lazy, where whatever needed to happen happened. Throughout watching the last seasons I was laughing at how poorly written the situations were; someone didn't want to do something but they still did it just because? People claim this anime is amazing and the best, but is is overhyped. It was promising at first, the story and situations were honestly great, but it turned into a nonsense story that is on par with a ChatGPT story. I know far more people who stopped watching anime altogether after watching this poorly written anime than those who enjoyed it and became obsessed with it because society told them they should love it. I know far more people who tried to give anime a shot and chose this, but now claim ""all anime is trash"" than the people who make multiple accounts and spam the positive reviews for this anime. I don't reccomend this, I'd actually advise people to not watch this past season 2.",10,106,"Jun 23, 2024"
10,The best series I've ever watch,"Attack on titan is easily one of the best (if not the best) series I've ever watch (including both animated and non-animated series); the way it is written, its plot twists, the way the character are very well written (and not sexualized), the way it is constructed, the way everything is connected, and many other things make this series a masterpiece. Attack on titan doesn't have things like ""fillings"", nor anything that would make it boring or too long for viewers, or readers in the case of the manga series. I 100% would recommend it, and I wish more people knew about such amazing work. Attack on titan definitely deserves a 10 out of 10!",9,1,"Mar 18, 2023"
10,Perfection,"I've finished the Manga and I can only say that AoT is the mist perfect and beautiful Media i ever seen or ever gonna see. Everything from the start to the end is completely trough out. It is so smart and soooo Brain, every Charakter is getting showed and gets a personality even Charakters you hate like Gabi. Attack on Titan is a Gift we got and that everyone should enjoy it and People who haven't watched it are missing on something so big and sooo great, A year ago even I hated it but then i watched it and watched it and now i love it as a passion and im also sad that I Can never watch something with a hype that i had with AoT.",9,1,"Mar 12, 2023"
10,THE BEST ANIME ROR EVER,"This is the best artwork in terms of plot, story, writing, characters, drawing and animation, development of characters and events, drama. It is the only anime capable of competing with series and movies and reconciling them . I can't wait for the last episode, it's going to be the best ever, it's going to be amazing. There is not a single bad episode in this work of art. The lowest episode rated 8.1 is really great. He was nominated for 30 awards and won 21. It is THE TOP Rated TV #27. The highest rating for an episode was 9.9 and it was in episode S3. E17, despite One Piece fans trying to reduce the rating.",9,1,"Mar 9, 2023"

The connection to how the story flows, you're never lost, the character development, and not to mention there isn't a single filler episode. Every single episode is important and honestly you would probably get hooked after season 1 episode 4, you just won't stop and you'll just witness just absolute greatness.

That being said, I'm really glad my wife started watching this gem on Netflix. We binge watched the first season within three evenings. And I really didn't notice anything that bothered me while watching it. It was just a perfect show. What really surprised me, was the diversity of characters and the really intelligent and often quite philosophical dialogues.",14,3,"Mar 25, 2020"
10,this show changed my point of view towards anime,"There was a bet between me and my friend and i lost that bet and my punishment was to watch this show, well i had no choice but to watch it and i didn't like anime back then, i was from those people who say ""anime is for kids"" but that changed after i watched this anime, when i watched the first two episodes i wasn't surprised beacause it was as stupid as i expected and i couldn't stop my self from laughing on hearing the japanese lang, but it started to get interesting gradually till episode five which made me stay up 10 hours till i finished it all and now it is one of the best i've ever seen in my life, i'm now a weeb thanks to AOT❤.",14,3,"Jun 4, 2019"
7,"Good, but not great","I just finished watching the entire 1st season (in only one day), so that can say a great deal about the script behind this anime. Yeah... the script is very interesting, well written. It has that ""touch"" of curiosity required by any decent anime. But... when it comes to graphics... it's an entire other story. For a 2013 production... I was expecting a much much higher quality of the scenes, of the special effects, of the face details... and especially of the monsters... Common people... is this for real? When I look the giants I'm remembering my anatomy classes from high school... Most of them look like they were painted by 10 y.o. children... and in some fight scenes, their graphics is in total contrast with the background... The generic... is too long, but the music is very catchy.",2,30,"Aug 13, 2014"

9,Extremely addictive,"Attack on Titan is absolutely incredible and is not to be missed. I love everything this show is doing so far. It's characters, while not terribly original or complex, are cool and I want them to win, the animation is brilliant, particularly during the battle scenes, and each episode ends with me wanting more. There is more than just those things that make the show worth watching though. The show deals with death and hopelessness very well. When people die, you feel the weight of it. At times, certain situations really do feel utterly hopeless, which makes it all the more satisfying when they win. Oh and you can't write a review of this show without mentioning the kick ass theme songs. Both set the mood of the show while sounding awesome at the same time. I do love the song that plays with the first half of the show, but surprisingly, I actually like the second more. This is the only time I've ever felt that way about a show's theme song. As of writing this, Attack on Titan is my favorite anime TV show and I am dying to see the second season. Bring me more! 9.5/10",27,9,"Dec 14, 2014"

I kinda see most animes as depressive (not that i wasn't into the thing for a while, nor i have seen a lot of, neither to little of though).

Eager to see whats going to happen in the second season, liking the art and the fights, especially in turning points of the action, but most of the times you can see what's gonna happen, and the plot delivers in ""slo-mo"".

It's merely a pass for me though i have an eclectic taste in things.

The level of thought in the story put is insane and he takes elements from his first chapter and brings it up towards the end. I just really want to say thank you, Isayama for this amazing story that you handcrafted to almos perfection. I havent seen the ending, and even if I've heard bad things about the ending, I'm still waiting impatiently until the end this fall. Shingeki no Kyojin dare I say the best piece of television for the last decade.",11,2,"Aug 9, 2023"
10,Amazing,"I cannot stress this enough but I 100% recommend anyone to start this show. However it has a lot of deep meaning and would need you to focus as every little detail plays apart in the series. This was the first ever anime I've ever watched and it's what seriously got me into an anime. It'll forever be my favorite. It is honestly a masterpiece and ever since I've been rewatching it constantly. It has such a deep meaning and makes you want to carry it on. I feel like this anime is the anime that people who don't like anime should watch. I've recommended this show to many of my friends who don't like anime and they all loved it. It will most likely get you into your feelings a lot, there are a lot of sad scenes such as death and so on so do prepare yourself to be crying 24/7. It was worth the cries and I will never regret starting this anime. Even though I started it at such a young age of 6 I decided to start again at 8 and became obsessed and now I'm 16 and I am still obsessed. Genuinely love it so much and will always continue to. I don't want to get into too much detail because I feel so passionate about this series and I know I will end up spoiling too much. But it is definitely worth a watch.",11,2,"Apr 17, 2023"

An intensely detailed plot, that touches on deeply thoughtful themes and has narrative-wide arcs, Attack on Titan is a heart-breaking joy from beginning to end. I would highly recommend this to anyone who would let me, and I urge everyone who hasn't yet seen the show to drop everything and watch it as soon as possible. I could not rate this series higher if I tried.

One of my favourite aspects of AoT has to be the way the story evolves as it goes on: basically changing genres along with the perspectives of the viewer. An absolute must watch.",11,2,"Mar 3, 2023"

10,Existential + Buddhist Philosophy in an Allegory,"Two themes recur and even contrast each other at times in this amazing show. The first is the cycles of violence that perpetuate each other through war, revenge, nationalism, xenophobia, etc. The other is the role of the individual in making key choices that affect many, many other lives. The main characters are constantly put into difficult situations that demand impossible existential choices and anime is the best medium for this because we gain access to the characters thought process in a way that works very well in the heat of battle.

The show has few moments where nothing is happening. Each season is paced wonderfully and it is clear that every plot element serves the greater whole. Mysteries are dangled in front of you, but you are given the answers and then some!",11,2,"Sep 3, 2022"
10,Masterpiece,No words to describe it it's just a masterpiece in every way. Attack On Titan has done something no other show has been to replicate now that it has ended I will never find anything that even comes CLOSE to it. From plot twists to foreshadowing Attack On Titan has NAILED every aspect it presented. Attack On Titan is such a masterpiece my friends who do not like anime have tried it and have ALL become obsessed with it. Attack On Titan has brought out so many emotions including happy but sad ones too which left many of us in tears. I do Not think any other show in the future can even account for half of what Attack On Titan does. Attack On Titan is really just the goat.,11,2,"Nov 6, 2023"

9,The word 'Epic' falls short for this anime.,"The most hyped up anime of last year. And it definitely lives up to the hype.

The premise of the anime is that huge humanoid creatures called Titans almost drove humanity to the brink of extinction several 100 years ago. The only way humanity was able to survive was to build huge walls and live inside them. Very interesting stuff, and the story builds up nicely too. Since humanity is mostly in the dark about the titans, we as a viewer are subjected to the same treatment and slow reveals of new info as the plot about them as the plot moves forward is always exciting and shocking. The atmosphere is very grim and desperate. Sadness, hopelessness, loss etc is always looming overhead, perfect for this type of premise.

This anime has an extremely EPIC!! feel to it. The soundtrack, the speeches, the motivational talk, and of course the action, all have the highest level of epicness applied to them. In fact, the word 'Epic' falls short to describing it. And this is the strength of the anime. Underneath all this epic layer, you will find a large set of interesting characters, subplots and conflicts, all of which are far from being the best but are good enough. The protagonist is a good mix of shonen ingredients with nothing in excessive quantity. Its the EPIC layer over it which amplifies everything and even the simple stuff becomes awesome.

The animation quality is superb, one of the best I have seen so far in an anime. The environment, huge fights and fast movements of the characters using there gears is beautifully imagined and rendered. So pretty!! The action was OH SO SATISFYING. I can't express how awesome it was, extremely adrenaline fueled and impactful.

Soundtrack, like I mentioned earlier, is epic. Loud orchestral pieces like the ones you gear in end of the world type videos really amplify the on screen action.

On the downsides, it sometimes abruptly shifted tones, which was somewhat distracting. Also, some of the later episodes had slower pacing, which normally wouldn't have been a bother but seeing how explosive the earlier episodes were contrasted the later slower ones.

Overall, an amazing EPIC anime. One of the best I have seen. I haven't this much fun/enjoyment watching an anime since Fate/Zero (Another epic anime). If you still haven't watched this anime, stop everything and watch it asap, if nothing else you'll at least enjoy the epicness. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!

Let's not debate over the ending, be thankful and show appreciation to the author for this amazingly written story; as well as WIT Studio, MAPPA Studio and Hiroyuki Sawano for bringing this story to life, showing the world what 'craftsmanship' truly is.

What the author has been trying to say is that there shouldn't be discrimination between races, besides, war only leads to war. So let's just all embrace the journey, but not fight over the end.",13,3,"Nov 7, 2023"

So I'm a fan of anime and I have watched many animes and generally enjoy them all. Maybe I'm just easily entertained, but nonetheless, a friend of mine suggested this to me and I gave it a shot. And to be perfectly honest I was blown away, like blown away away. I can't even describe the intensity of this show and I felt a huge urge to share it with anyone and everyone I knew who watched anime, so I did. I had never done that before with any of the animes I've watched. I also didn't tell them how amazing this show was because I wanted them to see it in all its splendor for themselves, while usually when I like a show I just say its good. Every episode I pretty much freaked out and made noises out loud from how hype this show is. It is now my favorite show of all time and I can't even describe how awesome this show is. People who do not like the show are just very very confused.",7,85,"Oct 20, 2013"
10,Unreal story,"I'm writing this just after watching the finale premier and the tldr is: Start to finish best show I have ever seen.

Having now watched the whole show three times through I can say this is not my favorite anime, but favorite tv show no matter the medium. I try and get everyone I know who can handle the brutal nature of this show to watch it.

I have only ever have one request from my best friend, and that is if I ever have amnesia, or any type of memory loss that the first thing he should do is rewatch this with me. I'm sure it would awaken all of my memories, even the ones from 2000 years ago.",13,3,"Nov 10, 2023"
10,The GREATEST anime in history!,"I am not a die-hard anime fan, I've only been involved in a few anime/manga series because most aren't that good, but this is a HUGE exception.

The plot is amazing and filled with plot twists. You never know what quite to expect.

The action is incredible and will leave you wanting more (as of this review, the best battle is the season 3 climax.) Character development is slow at first but it gets better later on.

There's not a single filler episode either!

It took me a year to watch all of season one, but don't wait that long, this series is worth your time. This is not one of the best shows ever, it IS the best show ever!",13,3,"Apr 9, 2022"
10,Best,"Aot rocked my world, i would not watch anime that often but this anime made me watch other animes after this.

10,It's beyond what Humanity have experienced until Now,"I can't believe myself that I waited so long for it. And when I try, I was perplexed after witnessing the first episode. I have never seen first episode to such intense.

And by the ending of the first episode, I was blown away. And within that moment, I knew this is going to be one of the greatest anime in the history of Anime.

Within the first season, I afraid that after watching this I might not like other Anime. Anyway now went second season and the first part of the third season. Then I went to IMDb to write a review about it.

Then I read a review by warFirel where the reader just wrote: ""The best part of the series is coming in April 2019, all of the entire show is not compare to what is coming now, nobody is ready for that.""

I knew that it's going to be amazing those words made my hope higher.

And then came the Season 3 Part 2 and the rest is history.

I am unable to anticipate what will happen in the 4th season but like that review I knew that nobody is ready for what we have to experience.",13,3,"Jan 12, 2020"
10,Rated!,The story is amazing. Character development are phenomenal as well as the character designs themselves. The fact that the main protagonist is the main antagonist makes the whole thing even more interesting and fun to watch. It always leaves you hanging on what's gonna happen next.,13,3,"Apr 6, 2022"
9,One of the Best TV Series of All Time,"Where do I even begin? The amount of depth, foreshadowing and messages contained in this show is astounding. Sometimes you have quick shots of animals doing what they want. It represents freedom, and everything the main characters want. But it also shows how with all the technology and things to do in this world, most animals are still freer than most people ever will be. And if you really think about it, the basic premise of this show is just a glorified version of how too many people in this world feel. Trapped, surrounded by monsters.

The foreshadowing in this show is the best I've ever seen and it's not even close. Mind you, I'm 15 years old and haven't seen a whole lot, but it still blows everything I've seen previously out of the water, it's unbelievable. When a show like Attack on Titan has as many twist turns as it does, you would expect it to not be nearly as entertaining on the second watch. Wrong. That's because almost every little detail that you thought had no meaning at the time makes so much sense to the overall story now. So many times was it alluded to about ""that"" reveal in season 2, it's honestly just mindblowing. So watching it a second time is almost just as enjoyable as the first, because now you can pick up on these things.

And absolutely everything that didn't make sense to you before, makes sense the second time. EVERY little detail that didn't make sense is explained. Even something like why Ymir acts the way she does. You could write that off as just an annoying one dimensional character. But there are reasons behind why she is, and it makes complete and perfect sense. And that's only one of the many, many examples of this in the show.

On to season 1(I'm not going to be reviewing every season, but there are some important things that need to be said here). If someone has only watched season 1, it would be pretty understandable why they might hate the show. I'm not saying I didn't like season 1, I love it, but it doesn't necessarily have the cohesive storyline that the other seasons have. It's a bit all over the place, and the story is somewhat lacking, but it makes up for that with its twist and turns.

But every other season after that, does have that cohesive storyline, albeit maybe not as many shocking moments (although they're definitely still there and are mind blowing). And that sort of leads into another reason that makes this show so good. Every season is different from one another. Season 1 is an action packed rollercoaster, season 2 focuses on the side characters and adds some much needed character development. Season 3 completely changes the identity of the show, becoming a sort of political thriller and has a TON of backstory. Season 3 Part 2 combines the elements of previous seasons but somehow makes it 2x better. And season 4 elevates the story to entirely new heights and you might as well just call it a completely different show.

So don't think this show is going to suck simply because it's anime. I tried for a while to convince my dad to watch it who was skeptical, and he's loved it so far.

Also I recommend watching the show in the original Japanese with subtitles, although the English dub is definitely not bad.",13,3,"May 29, 2021"
10,Incredible,"Watching Attack on Titan is like being on a rollercoaster with 15 loops and somehow not getting dizzy. I don't know how else to describe it. Never in my life have I been subject to so many plot points, twists and themes. With this show basically changing genre at the frequency with which zoomers change genders you'd think Attack on Titan would wind up an incoherent mess, but it doesn't. Attack on Titan always keeps you on your toes while never letting go of your attention. This masterpiece will surely go down in historia.",13,3,"Apr 4, 2022"
10,Storytelling Masterpiece,"I started watching this show about a year ago, unknowingly starting to watch season one in the midst of a very slow releasing fourth and final season. I haven't watched much anime before, but I always heard this was a good one. I expected to be hooked for the first bit of the series by an entertaining story and some interesting but eventually forgettable characters. I expected it to more or less be an animated Walking Dead - an interesting horror/action premise that loses taste and creativity after the first few seasons.

Man was I wrong.

This show has blown me away more times than I can count. There have been so many episodes where afterwards I have stopped and thought ""am I crazy, or this is one of the best shows ever made? Why hasn't everyone watched this?"" I've seen a lot of excellent TV, but in some ways this show puts many others to shame. The care and intricacy put in to the story writing is truly remarkable. The writers weave arcs and story lines between seasons with amazing consistency, leading to truly epic scenes and moments. Every time something I don't like happens on the show, I have to remember what show I'm watching, and I have to remember that these people know what their doing. And I can't think of one time where I have been disappointed after seeing the whole story play out. I came for the action - which is absolutely amazing - but I'm staying for the story. This series is endlessly creative and complex in a way that feels intentional. The creators aren't just putting out more episodes because the show is popular. They're telling an epic story and I am 100% sold on it.

Watch this show.",13,3,"Jul 4, 2022"

If you don't count American cartoons like South Park or avatar etc. I'm not sure if they count, I'm new here sorry.. anyways, yeah this was 10/10 for me. Absolutely love the story & the action, mostly the story. It's so well written, I'm really excited for the final season.

This is my first real introduction to anime and I feel it was sooo good that now I worry Iv set the bar too high to really dive into anything else.. I'm not sure what to watch next, Iv heard good things about demon slayer so I might start that and see what's it's like. AoT though has been top tier in entertainment, animation & story line. I really hope when it all over I find something again just as good as this!

Anyways if you're new to anime like myself, definitely watch this one, absolutely amazing!",13,3,"Nov 6, 2022"
10,Masterpiece,"From the begging to the end, not a second is wasted on the story. What a example of a perfect storytelling. Not at all another story of a hero or anti-hero. A story of love, suffering, humanity, opression, violence, anger... just perfect. The animation is beatiful. The development of the characters, each one with your singularities, way of life, pains and loves. Just incredible.

It invites us to think how we treat the different, and how do we just repeat and reproduce some very old thougts and behaviours just because we we're tod to do so.

But NOTHING is better than Attack on Titan. Best story, absurd character development. Anyone who gives less than 10 for this masterpiece is already dead inside.

Rummbling part was really unnecessary and something different could have been shown to remove the titan power from the world, both eren and mikasa don't deserve this. Specially watching mikasa like that at the end makes sad.

AND dont just judge an anime by the first season I would agree that the first season is just dumb action and Mikasa shouting Eren. But just hang in there its just going to get better. Yes this is not the best anime or anything but don't go down by the people rating it 1 star, seriously? did they even watch anime?? I would say they are just out right haters. Hang in there all your questions will be answered. And not to mention the 4th season the protagonist Eren will only get better and even Mikasa too. This anime just gets better season by season. Not to mention the sound tracks they are some of the best tracks that I've heard. Watch this anime you many witness one of the best written show. PS there are no plotholes. Those who are saying that there are plotholes are just those who haven't completed the anime. Some of the early chapters have foreshadowing from as far as 120+ chapter.

This stopped the titans for a while, but after a few years, a gigantic being appears to end humanity's peace, leading the protagonists to chaotic, action-packed and very exciting events.

10,Masterpiece,"For me This will be the best piece of work until I die A Heartwarming Review of ""Attack on Titan""

""Attack on Titan"" is more than just an anime-it's an emotional journey that will stay with you long after the final episode. Set in a dystopian world where humanity is pushed to the brink of extinction by monstrous Titans, the series introduces viewers to a gripping tale of survival, sacrifice, and humanity's enduring spirit in the face of unimaginable odds. While it may initially appear to be a typical action-packed series, ""Attack on Titan"" quickly evolves into a masterpiece, deftly weaving together themes of war, freedom, and the human condition.

One of the most striking elements of the series is the depth of its storytelling. From the very first episode, you are thrust into a world full of danger and mystery, but as the story unfolds, it becomes clear that this is no ordinary tale of humans versus monsters. The narrative is rich with political intrigue, personal conflicts, and moral dilemmas, making each episode feel vital and consequential. The creators have masterfully balanced intense action sequences with slower, more reflective moments that allow for character development and philosophical exploration.

The characters themselves are one of the show's greatest strengths. At the heart of the series is Eren Yeager, a young boy who experiences tragedy at the hands of the Titans and vows to fight back. However, ""Attack on Titan"" is not content with a simple tale of vengeance. Eren's growth, alongside that of his closest friends, Mikasa Ackerman and Armin Arlert, is complex and multi-layered. Each of these characters faces challenges that test their resolve, pushing them to confront their deepest fears and question their beliefs. It is through these struggles that the series presents its most poignant messages about hope, friendship, and the price of freedom.

Mikasa, for instance, is the epitome of loyalty and strength, a character who embodies the love and dedication that can exist even in the darkest times. Her relationship with Eren is one of the emotional cores of the story, and her quiet resilience is deeply moving. Armin, on the other hand, represents intellect and compassion. His journey is one of self-discovery, as he wrestles with the burden of his own doubts while trying to live up to the expectations placed on him. Together, these characters create a dynamic and compelling trio that anchors the series.

The world-building in ""Attack on Titan"" is equally exceptional. The creators have constructed a vivid and terrifying setting, where enormous walls separate the last of humanity from the Titans outside. This claustrophobic environment mirrors the feelings of fear and helplessness that permeate the story, but it also serves as a metaphor for the constraints placed on human freedom and the desire to break free. As the series progresses, viewers are given glimpses of a much larger world beyond the walls, and the mysteries that surround the Titans and their origins keep the audience on the edge of their seats.

Visually, ""Attack on Titan"" is breathtaking. The animation, especially during the action sequences, is fluid and exhilarating, bringing the terrifying presence of the Titans to life with incredible detail. The scenes of humans flying through the air with their omni-directional mobility gear are some of the most iconic in anime, creating a sense of speed and danger that leaves you breathless. The art style perfectly complements the tone of the show, with its sharp contrasts and often bleak landscapes serving as a stark reminder of the harsh world the characters inhabit.",5,0,"Oct 14, 2024"

I can't say that I even understand who is supposed to be the main character, and I can't say that I care all that much either. Watching this series I want everyone to lose.

10,"A spectacular body of work, not just for Anime fans...","I'll admit, when I started watching Attack on Titan when it aired back in the early 2010s, my anime knowledge was limited to a handful of Naruto arcs and a Dragon Ball video game from when I was a child, I had no idea what I was getting into. Fast forward a decade and I've watched (and read) Attack on Titan in its entirety on numerous occasions and have managed to convince most of my inner circle to do the same, because Attack on Titan -or Shingeki No Kyojin as it is known in its native tongue- is a special television show that deserves to be watched by anybody who appreciates epic, bleak, frenetic and meticulous storytelling.

From its soundtrack, to its voice acting, to the animation and everything in between, Attack on Titan succeeds across the board. Narratively the show evolves from a fairly straightforward yarn about uncanny Goliaths laying waste to the remaining vestiges of humanity to a far more complex and emotionally engaging tale about the cycles of violence inherent in society with iconic, layered and endearing characters at the heart of it.

Each season of AoT raises the stakes and reveals additional lore that recontextualizes everything you thought you knew about the show in satisfying and often times, unsettling ways.

I do believe that a person's enjoyment of Attack on Titan will vary dramatically depending on how receptive they are of the show's messages and tone. There is a deeply nihilistic and bleak atmosphere to most every episode with only brief moments of respite sprinkled few and far between and I can see this being somewhat a deal breaker for a few people, especially those more accustomed to anime such as One Piece, My Hero Academia or Food Wars where the palette is colourful and the humour is constant.

If you've been sniffing around Attack on Titan for an age wondering if maybe it's your thing because your anime obsessed friend told you to watch it or the consistently high reviews peaked your interest, definitely give it a watch and form your own opinion.

You never know, it could be your favourite show.

9,Epic and Hype,"Highly recommended, a must-see for anyone who enjoys a thoroughly compelling show with great characters, music, mystery, suspense, hype, epicness, and so on.

Right through the entire series, I would cry, get chills & goosebumps, and have to rewatch particular scenes over and over because of how stunning they were.

As much as some people may say this show is overrated or overhyped, it can hardly be denied that AoT is easily one of the most accessible animes for worldwide audiences.

The story is quite unique and compellingly presented. Granted it's not flawless, and some episodes might feel clunky in places, but overall AoT is a superb series which everyone should experience at least once, and ideally on a big screen with great audio (or quality headphones), and if you haven't seen it before, I'd suggest you see it with a bunch people who also haven't seen it before. The hype, thrill-factor and action of AoT is certainly real, if you allow it to take you for that ride.

In comparing it to other great animes, I would say I like Berserk more overall, but sadly that only had one season, whereas AoT will have four by the time it finishes. Both of them repetedly made me cry, and feel a whole range of emotions. I think Berserk wastes not one second with filler, whereas it could be argued that AoT tiptoes into filler territory at times.

Nonetheless, AoT is a riproaring adventure which pretty much anyone can quickly get invested in and enjoy. I am keenly looking forward to Season 4.",5,0,"Jan 14, 2020"

5,Pure suffering,"It's been a long time since I stopped caring about the series, but I wanted to do this review anyway to show how much I hate it.

After the first season, I had to force myself to watch every episode, often fast-forwarding through painfully paced episodes.

After 10 years, when I finally came to the end of the series, the only thing I can remember about the whole horrible watching process is that I wanted to kill myself out of boredom more than once.

Honestly, the experience was so bad that I lost interest in all anime after watching Attack on Titan. I only gave this rating for the sake of the first season.

As a result, it gives me a little peace of mind to know that the series is really over and will not continue.",3,44,"Mar 15, 2024"

7,A Decade-Long Odyssey with Attack on Titan,"Season 4 is already halfway through, and I've found myself revisiting the previous seasons once again. It truly stands out as a masterpiece on all levels. I had to pause S1E06 just now to write this review because 9 minutes into that episode had me crying once more.

I've been following AoT since 2013, eagerly awaiting each new episode and season. It's hard to believe the series is ending very soon. ""Don't be sad that it's over, be happy that it happened,"" and all that...

For a while, my top 3 ongoing shows were GoT, Vikings, and AoT. Sadly, GoT collapsed before the finish line, Vikings gradually lost quality after its fourth season, while Attack on Titan has remained strong and not only stayed brilliant but actually improved in many ways as the show progressed, which is incredibly rare.

To this day, I still listen to the amazing soundtrack while doing other things, and each time I return to watching the show, it's hard to find anything negative about it. Some people may say that AoT is overrated, and I might have thought that at some points in the show as well, such as at various points in Season 2 and 3. However, when you see how it all connects together and makes overall sense in the grand scheme, some seemingly weaker aspects or things that appear nonsensical, overly contrived, or dramatized at the time make sense upon revisiting it, or at least that was my experience.

In any case, I would give Attack on Titan a 10/10 simply because it is intensely watchable, engaging, inspiring, epic, thought-provoking, anti-war, spine-chilling, horrifying at times, emotional, and tear-inducing.

If you enjoyed the early seasons of Game of Thrones, Vikings, Breaking Bad, Fullmetal Alchemist, and other similar shows, then Attack on Titan is definitely for you.

Now, I must endure the agonizing anticipation for each new and final episode of the last season...

It could do less with typical Japanese nonsense, but everything is done very well. It's beautiful and the titans expressions are rather frightening.

However, once I started watching season 3 the show completely went upside down for me.

It went from being about humans vs titans to a human vs human drama.

Great animation. Some use of CGI, it's sometimes poor but overall okay. Story is really good, and the world building is spectacular.

It's gorey and bloody, and really tragic though. Not for the faintest of heart...

There are a lot of different working parts to this series, and it works well for people who are new to anime.

Overall really really good, highly recommend for people who like fantasy and action, as well as some tragic-ness and gore.

10,The Greatest Anime If Not The Greatest Work of Fiction!!,"I never thought I'd be writing a review about an anime, but here I am, convinced that ""Attack on Titan"" is one of the greatest series out there, not just in anime but across all fiction. As someone who usually sticks to shows like ""Breaking Bad,"" ""Stranger Things,"" and ""Money Heist,"" AOT blew me away.

The character development is incredible. Eren, Mikasa, and Armin evolve in ways that feel genuine and relatable, reflecting the series' dark and intense narrative. Their arcs delve into profound themes of humanity, freedom, and sacrifice.

The plot itself is a thrilling ride filled with unexpected twists and moral dilemmas that keep you on edge. The world-building is rich and immersive, crafting a dystopian setting where survival is a constant struggle. The themes of oppression and freedom hit hard, making it more than just an action series.

While some people have issues with the ending, I think it captures the complexities of the characters and their world beautifully. I enjoyed every episode, as the story builds in a way that is both engaging and thought-provoking.

If you're hesitant about trying anime, I urge you to give AOT a shot. It goes beyond typical genre expectations and offers a storytelling experience that rivals acclaimed shows like ""Breaking Bad."" Trust me, as someone who used to dislike anime, AOT changed my mind completely.

In short, ""Attack on Titan"" is a sensational 10/10 series that deserves all the praise it gets. Whether you're an anime veteran or just looking for something new, this series is a journey you won't want to miss.",5,0,"Oct 16, 2024"

10,Farewell .... Eren,"I've been waiting and dreading for almost 12 years.

I've been with this series ever since I was just a scrawny kid in middle school when my cousin showed me the computer game and then the next year after that, my best friend showed me one of the Greatest Tv Shows to ever exist for the first time.

At first, It scared the crap out of me, the idea of giants that look like people who eat us alive, it was like my worst nightmare straight out of the walking dead, but bigger. It was a good long while before I got over that and really built up the courage to pay attention to the story and characters who lived it.

This was one of the first few anime I had ever watched at that point knowing what the word ""Anime"" truly meant, an undeniable beautiful art form for expression that transcends where it goes to be seen and comes from.

I have evolved more as a person over these last 10 years because of this show alongside side these amazing and inspiring characters. I've watched many of them suffer and die horrible deaths for their beliefs and struggles for a world where they can live in peace and freedom for all mankind.

But, both Attack On Titan and the reality of life is that the world can be a truly cruel and unforgivable place, with hell on Earth for those caught in it, but what makes it worth being in is the people you share your life and pain with.

The lives that you've impacted and have been impacted by thanks to the actions of others. As long as you have those people who you are truly close with and trust with your life, you can bring down any giant that comes your way.

Without Attack On Titan, without this once in a century human story, its many diverse characters and themes of the experience of human life

.......

Without Eren Jaeger, I wouldn't be the person am I today that most know me as. Thanks to all of them, I tried my best to socialize more in school and meet newer people I could call my friends.

As I got older I was amazed how Eren, in his own way, mastered both his uncontrolled rage and his Incredible strength, which at times threatened his comrades and turned it against the insurmountable odds that would destroy his home. He became a better person for it by learning to point them towards positive outcomes. Then in high school, I took those qualities I saw in him that were inspiring to me and I found them hidden deep within in myself, By turning it into a positive but fierce determination that inspired me to explore outside my shell for the first time in my life.

To try something different from what I was used to. So I joined a more competitive sport than any other on campus, Wrestling. It was there I was able to grow more as a social individual who isn't held back by any pre existing conditions that limits my communication and to physically better myself while having fun working with others.

This show, this story, These Remarkable yet also ordinary people who went through hell allowed me to be a more driven and determined person who never wants to be held back by anything ever again. Someone who smashes through life's obstacles as they come at you no matter how hard or how giant they are.

You could be like some people and tell me that it's just a show. That these people aren't even real to begin with.

But they are, to me and Millions of people across the Entire world.

Attack on Titan taught me how to persevere through all the bad and to enjoy all of the good my life has to offer me and for that I personally thank the Author: Hajime Isayama, the teams behind the incredible animation, and all the voice actors who gave these characters a voice to be heard throughout the world Until next time Eren Jaeger, I'll see you around Shinzo Sasageyo- ""Dedicate your hearts""",5,0,"Feb 12, 2025"

10,Why it doesn't have more stars?,"English is not my first language so I'll try my best.

This is the best anime series that I have watched in my life, and I'll share my opinion about this anime.

First, it has an awesome well-written plot, maybe this is the main reason that makes this show the GOAT. It has a lot of incredible plot twists that makes you think about what's next, explaining things that happened before and you will never be able to predict them. The story is nearly perfect 10/10, and every episode is breathtaking.

The animation, just, wow... Both Wit Studio and MAPPA made a real masterpiece with the animation process, the fact is that you fall in love watching a single scene of this series because of the beauty it has. The color, the shadows, lights, movements... are just pleasure for eyes. And the style of the drawing is realistic and doesn't contain childish things that other anime shows have. 10/10

The soundtracks are amazing, every theme used in this show makes you feel every kinds of feelings, especially in fight scenes. Nothing to say, 10/10 easily.

This show is not just for people who watch anime, this show is for everyone, it can be compared with life action shows like GoT or Breaking Bad, and I didn't believe that when people recommended me AoT before I watched. After this show I feel like it doesn't have any other show that surpases this one. AoT is the GOAT. It deserves much more stars, 8.8 is unacceptable, it must have more than 9.5, is nearly perfect.",5,0,"Dec 31, 2020"
9,Attack on Titan or...human,"As humans and, therefore, beings with a need to embellish our reality, we are highly prone to hyperbole, especially concerning the fruits of the manga-anime industry. Exaggerated views and obsessed fandoms are dominant factors behind the curiosity of ""outsiders"" who drawn from our enthusiasm delve into different series only to find themselves, on many occasions, searching for the allure. Every rule however that respects itself is complimented by at least one exception. Enter Attack on Titan.

In contrast to other series that are hanging between impressive worlbuilding and bland characters or the opposite, ""AOT"" chooses to present an interactive relationship between its characters and the harsh reality that envelops them. In a bleak dystopia of cruel deaths, political corruption and ethnological complexity there is no character that can be painted with a binary mindset. Devotion, fiery idealism that pines for freedom and self-sacrifice exist along with nihilism, mass killing and deceit in the face of no other than Eren, our anti-hero MC. What makes Eren a refreshingly original character is the fact that he has the heart of a hero but a ruthless reality forces him to think like a villain, resembling a snake that changes it's skin in it's path for survival.

The extensive cast that accompanies Eren in his descent (or ascent?) to a changed reality as the series progresses is equally captivating with fascinating characters who represent different facets of our behavioral spectrum; strategists who make cold, devilish decisions, kindhearted diplomats with a knack for manipulation and fierce warriors with an opaque sense of identity are representative indicatives of the creator's will to constantly surprise us with the characters' reaction to a world they cannot control. The fact that some of the most interesting ones are female-an angelic, stubborn queen and a controversial Titan with a turbulent past are probably ringing some bells-only adds to the allure.

Apart from a character study, though, AOT is also a series with strong elements of action. The fight scenes are masterfully presented and create a thrilling impression what with the meticulous animation, epic soundtrack and steampunk vibes. The use of color is also something to be commented on as the warm earthy tones that are usually used, work as a visual irony considering the amount of icy killing intent that fuels many of the scenes.

If you ask me whether this series can be rewatched I would reply that it depends on your psychological stamina. However, even one time makes for a compelling watch. AOT is truly bleak and a hard pill to swallow. There is no character to idolize or demonize. Nevertheless, its philosophical take on freedom and survival is a ""mental"" attack that we are definitely in need of.",5,0,"Oct 23, 2021"

10,One of the best anime there is,"The show starts of perfectly. You understand everything you need to and you experience everything the main character does. The first season really leaves you wanting for more. It has so many secrets that you just want to know and understand. You get attached to every character and most of them have a really good backstory (you can't have a backstory for every character, but the main ones do). The show is ready to kill any character when you least expect it. Sometimes the show won't explain what's going on and as the characters talk it will get more clear, but none of the characters know everything. While watching this I was coming up with my own theories and some of them were true. I figured some of the show out not because it was really easy to predict, but because I put the information I got from the characters (in a natural way, no information is ever really forced). You should definitly watch this. If you really don't like blood and gore this is not the show for you. Every fight scene is really bloody and I like that. Not for everyone.",5,0,"Feb 19, 2020"
10,Flawless,"""Attack on Titan"" is a masterful anime set in a dystopian world besieged by Titans. The story follows Eren Yeager and friends, exploring themes of survival and freedom.

10,A 2016 perspective,"Originally saw this series back in 2013 when it was released weekly, and only had English subs available. During then, this anime lost me around episodes 6-7. No, it was not because it wasn't good. It was good even back then. Really. But having so much back stories and characters involved, and needing to read the subs and waiting for weekly installments, i guess it got too confusing for me to follow. I always knew that i would return once the series had completed.

Three years later, having put it on hold for so long, i chose to watch English dub now as i just wanted to enjoy the series for what it was and not be worried about reading subs. Binge watched this in its entirety in just 2 days. It was that compelling.

One of the best anime series that i have ever seen. The characters had compelling back stories, and most importantly, i found myself caring, cheering, smiling, at their antics as the series went on. From start to finish, being able to watch the three main protagonist grew, and watching the class of recruits grew together was the best aspects that this series had given me.

The animation was fluid. Fight scenes were seen clearly, although fast - very fast at times - but it was animated and does not rely on cuts and ""use your imagination cheats"" like some animes do. And i really like animes that does not have the usual ""cute"" ""nose bleed"" moments.

10,Great storyline 👌🏻,"As someone who doesn't like anime and he was forced this one by his friends, I should say that you should not hesitate to watch Attack on Titan! This anime will keep you glued to your device with its unique storyline and characters.

Drama is the first word in the story of this anime. It's story is filled with the excitement of unexpected expenses and you can't tell what will happen next moment. It is the reason for its attractiveness and high score.

Without a doubt, I recommend watching Attack on Titan to all my friends and the people of the world so that they too can enjoy it and get excited when they see it. If you haven't seen it yet and came to the comments to make up your mind, put aside your doubts and start watching the damn thing right now!",8,1,"Apr 28, 2023"
10,This anime is an 8 season show,"This show stands out as one of, if not the best at having remarkable rewatch value thanks to the masterful foreshadowing, great foundation, and set up done in the earlier seasons. Once you complete all 4 seasons and rewatch it again, it feels like you are watching an entirely new show. Every tiny detail becomes increasingly noticeable, and each plot twist resonates with greater impact. It's almost funny how you don't notice these hidden details in your first viewing. Even internal or external monologues that seem insignificant at first, take on a whole new meaning when you watch it again. If you love animation in general, you should watch this anime!",8,1,"Apr 26, 2024"

10,Best plot and storytelling !,I never had experienced such a way of story telling and plot and twists it unravels. Almost every department of technical works done a picasso kind of work. How could one portray one such intense screenplay in an anime . OMG I'm just spellbound. The simplest of characters and incidents have a great say in this anime epic . The dub and sub both were excellent !! . The animation was outright the best one I saw. Every now and then it's a edge of a seat moment in this anime ( how could one create such an intense screenplay play in an anime ) . The fact that one could actually understand the plot only in the penultimate season ( as of we know that season 4 is yet to come and the ultimate finale of this epic anime ) . Every character is portrayed well with excellence. Im just waiting impatiently for season 4 .,8,1,"Feb 1, 2020"

5,"Has its moments, but often frustrating","I'll start by saying I generally enjoyed it. There's a lot I disliked though, which I'll list a few points.

Firstly, the main character is a psychopath. He shows virtually zero empathy for his friends.

No character development means if you didn't like him at the start, you won't like him at the end of the first season. It makes understanding why Mikasa cares for him confusing, even with exposition shoved in your face. Not saying he has to be a Mr. Nice Guy, but throw us a bone here!

Secondly, the first season is about 10 episodes too long. There's too much filler and pointless side stories. Then the final plot twist is just way too obvious.

I could rant and nitpick for days, but in the end, the show is okay. It's just not quite there.",3,94,"Oct 21, 2018"
10,An epic tragedy. A modern literary classic,"A show that draws you in with the promise of action, only to turn the genre upside down and make you question why humanity turns to violence.

At it's core, Attack on Titan is a mystery drama that fools you with it's initial simplicity. Yet the story progresses at a lightning pace that subverts expectations at every turn, but still makes logical sense in hindsight. By the time I've reached the final season, I could not believe how rich the story had become. It's unbelievable that what's been done by this series was even possible for the genre.

The writing is done right. That's a simple statement that rarely applies to other shows. This show knows how to withhold information. How to keep the suspense. When to use flashbacks to the maximum effect. Just when you think you know where the story is progressing, you are reminded that you are watching Attack on Titan and you don't know everything. There were many moments that were not only surprising, but also deeply emotionally impactful, which creates the many big moments this show is known for.

The show presents some moral themes that make you question what defines good and what defines evil, it presents both sides the moral arguments and the characters face, it ends up becoming a battle of ideology instead of a simple hero vs villain conflict.

Attack on Titan will be remembered for many years to come. For me it has changed my personal outlook on life and my philosophy, and will always remain in my heart.",8,1,"Jul 31, 2021"
10,By far the greatest Show I've ever seen.,The story is complex and turns more into just Killing titans. The foreshadowing in this show is unparalleled. The Soundtrack makes this show go from a 10/10 to a 12/10. The animation is stunning and the characters are very likeable. If I could give 1 recommendation to anybody for any show. This would be it.,8,1,"Jan 16, 2021"
10,A work of art beyond anything we have seen,"Forget everything you know about story telling because this is something beyond. I wish I could forget everything about attack on Titan just to experience seeing it again.

I can't even start explaining how this work of art, that goes beyond the anime specter, surpasses anything I have seen before including movies and shows, and believe me I have seen a lot.

I'm just happy I'm alive in the same era Attack on titan came out. The story is nothing I've seen before, goes beyond expectation and the world we are introduced to gets bigger and bigger. Everything was meticulously calculated from the first episode. Everything has a meaning, every scene and character that is shown contributes to the story one way or the other. The subjects covered are far more intense that what we expect in the beginning. It's not a typical anime show where a hero gets to win with the power of friendship. There is love, treason, war, strategy, sacrifice, incredible fights, incredible music, a deep criticism of society, of fascism of a lot of things, and mainly, of what it is about what it takes to save the ones you love.

It is just Epic.",8,1,"Mar 21, 2023"

10,"Overwhelming, sublime, cruel, unhealthy...","Attach on Titans (or should i say Shingeki no Kyojin ) is a masterpiece and probably the best series of recent years, with a script of rare finesse. The first season plunges us into a ruthless universe, with the last humans desperately fighting nightmare monsters, and a hateful, almost cliché protagonist. But, it is the continuation of the scenario which comes to question everything: Monsters are not necessarily those which one believes... As the seasons go by, insignificiant details at the beginning will turn your brain, to finally paint a darker and darker picture of human nature... If you don't know, go for it.",8,1,"Mar 15, 2021"
10,Goat,"Watching anime, if someone told me an anime would be on the same playing field as Breaking Bad and even. KmfIn this dark and cruel world created by Hajime Isayama, while some things are objectively wrong, there's never a moment where you can definitively say that someone's the good guy or bad guy. Once you see the full picture of the show, it's indescribable to explain the show in the manner of good and bad considering how much everyone's in this it's just that good like there is not other show so philosophy and with so much symbolism or anything it's naturally interesting and emotional !!!!!!",8,1,"May 13, 2024"

10,Peak fiction,"There is no reason not to like this anime. It perfectly captures anger, turned hatred ultimately created from deep within ourselves. This pays homage to the manga story with the animated adaptation not leaving out significant scenes but instead using them to bring this to the next level. Don't ignore this series because this is an anime as you will miss out on in my opinion the best of what fiction has to offer with twists and turns throughout the story you would not be able to recognise with a high powered microscope.

The story takes surprising turns, challenging your assumptions about who the real enemies are. AOT isn't afraid to explore the darkness of war and the burden of fighting for survival. It's a must-watch for anyone who enjoys a complex, emotional anime with incredible action. Truly an unreal experience that barely any other show has been able to give me.",8,1,"May 12, 2024"

10,A Blueprint for Perfect Storytelling,"In my opinion, ""Attack on Titan"" has undoubtedly solidified its place as a masterpiece in the realm of television, earning praise from fans and critics alike. For someone not inclined towards anime, this series serves as an exception, hooking me and its viewers into its richly crafted world from the very first episode. One of the show's most commendable aspects is its phenomenal world building in its 1st season. From the towering walls that protect humanity's survivors to the terrifying Titans lurking beyond, every detail contributes to a sense of an immersive world that keeps audiences interested. Central to the show's appeal is its diverse and compelling cast of characters. Each one brings their own complexities and motivations to the table, making it impossible not to become invested in their character arcs. This, along with masterful storytelling and fantastic attention to detail, ensures that viewers are constantly on the edge of their seats.

""Attack on Titan"" is no stranger to plot twists and character betrayals, keeping audiences guessing and gasping. The unexpected turns and moral situations faced by the characters add layers of depth to the narrative, challenging viewers to change their perceptions of right and wrong. A standout element of the series is its beautiful score, which heightens every moment of tension and emotion.

His journey is a testament to the show's ability to subvert expectations and deliver gut wrenching twists that resonate long after the episodes are over. On top of its entertainment value, ""Attack on Titan"" tackles heavy themes with nuance and depth. From racism and oppression to the abuse of government power and the prevention of global genocide, the series confronts uncomfortable truths head on, forcing viewers to confront the darker aspects of humanity. In the latter seasons, one of the show's most intriguing aspects is how it constantly challenges the moralities of its characters, making it difficult to decide between protagonist and antagonist. The show leaves it up to the viewer to determine who, if anyone, is truly in the wrong, adding yet another layer of complexity to an already multifaceted story.

""Attack on Titan"" truly stands as a testament to the art of storytelling, captivating audiences with its plot, unforgettable characters, and thought provoking themes. Even for those not typically drawn to anime, this series is a must watch.

10,Best,It was my 1st anime and undoubtedly I chose the best for the starting 💘,8,1,"Apr 15, 2021"
10,Cinematic masterpiece,"Attack on Titan is an extraordinary anime series that redefines the genre with its complex narrative, intense action, and profound themes. Set in a world where humanity teeters on the brink of extinction due to giant humanoid Titans, the series explores survival, freedom, and the moral ambiguities of war. The intricate plot, filled with unexpected twists and deep character development, keeps viewers on the edge of their seats.

Comparing AOT to Game of Thrones is inevitable due to their shared traits of epic storytelling and shocking plot twists. Both series are masterful in building expansive worlds with rich histories and multifaceted characters. However, AOT surpasses GOT in several ways. While GOT faltered in its final seasons, AOT maintains its narrative cohesion and delivers a satisfying conclusion that resonates deeply with its audience. The emotional weight carried by AOT's characters, coupled with its relentless pace and philosophical depth, makes it not just a story of survival, but a profound commentary on human nature and societal constructs.

AOT's animation is another standout feature. The stunning visuals and fluid action sequences elevate the series, creating a visceral experience that captures the raw intensity of battle and the bleak beauty of its dystopian world. The soundtrack, composed by Hiroyuki Sawano, is nothing short of spectacular, perfectly complementing the series' dramatic highs and poignant lows.

In essence, while GOT set a high bar for fantasy dramas with its groundbreaking approach and production values, AOT not only matches but exceeds it by consistently delivering a gripping and thought-provoking narrative. Attack on Titan is a masterpiece that pushes the boundaries of anime and storytelling, leaving an indelible mark on its viewers and cementing its place as a modern classic.

From traumas, to purpose, to hope, belief, fear, despair, and a theme I believe many people need to watch this show for, the will to fight for what you believe in, the ability to accept no less than you, a human born into this world ULTIMATELY deserve, your freedom, your freedom physically, mentally, and emotionally.

10,*NO SPOILER REVIEW ON ATTACK ON TITAN*,"From the very first episode, I knew there will be no escape from this series being my favorite not just in anime but in all TV series ever made.

By the time, I finished season 3 part 2, I couldn't comprehend what I just witnessed. It's far better than live-action tv series not to mention all anime ever made.

The storyline is the base of Attack on Titan and with every episode, you would feel the suspense revealed and it will leave you scratching your head for sure.

The most recent plot twist is what makes the writer Genius. A True Genius!

The visual animation by Wit Studio is a work of praise. I could find any other studio to work on this anime. The animation is stunning and it did a great job to make the titan scary and horror once again.

Also, the mobility gears scenes are very well choreographed.

The music is really so up to the mark. It was the music that first caught my attention and it was perfect enough to sync with the intense and horror caused by Titans. And Hiroyuki Sawano is no one of my favorite music composers.

Not to mention all the openings are my favorite in anime.

The characters are so amazing. Levi is the most lovable character but Erwin Smith is the leader behind what humanity has achieved so far. Truly an amazing character.

Also, despite Eren being the main character. He was both helper and a liability for Humans which is I like the most. Not the rest of the anime where the protagonist single-handled defeats the villains.

The anime went beyond my expectations and I don't even know what will be happening in the final season. But whatever it is simply beyond what I have experienced so far.

This is my favorite anime series of all time.

Watched S4 and was a bit of a disappointment as certain members such as Wit Studio, Tetsuro Akari, and Hiroyuki Sawano wasn't part of the final season.

Mappa Animation was good but not like Wit. The brilliant direction was missing and so is the music. The Opening was amazing and certain OSTs are also good but they didn't give the feeling like the previous one. The story was brilliant as always.

Now all I wait is for the remaining episodes to see how it ends.",10,2,"Jul 25, 2021"
10,best story ever,I LOVE AOT it's the best anime in my opinion just not for kids maybe check the episode for gory and whatever you don't want you kid or teen seeing I am 9 and I watch it me and my mom stopped after erens mum got eaten it was too gory i read and love the books which are not that bad books 7+ show 11+ for me.,10,2,"Aug 19, 2022"
10,This type of show comes ONCE IN A CENTURY🔥🔥,"I normally don't comment anywhere,or give reviews. But man,this show made me review it. It is the most perfect show known to humankind. I feel proud that my eyes witnessed this masterpiece. The epic journey,unforgettable moments,mindbending plot twist,goated characters,It's all there!!!

This show doesn't fit in any particular genre,It has everything mixed in it perfectly. Thrill,Mysteries,Actions,Adventures, you name it,This show has it all!!

I mean you can't even imagine what's gonna happen next. Every season delivers something more than the previous one Hats down to the goated mangaka Hajime Isayama,The goated staffs of Wit studio & Mappa. Hats down to all those who worked to make this show an absolute MASTERPIECE Trully this types of show comes once in a century,and I feel very proud that I've lived when this show aired!!!!",10,2,"Aug 18, 2023"
10,AoT,"In case you like fantastic stories combined with drama, welcome. This anime is adapted from the manga with the same name written by Hajime Isayama. Animation, plot, art and interesting characters made this well-reviewed story. As far as I'm concerned, it's one of the best anime series.

In the beginning of AoT, son of common doctor (at first sight) Eren Yeager wants to leave town and go beyond the wall. But be careful what you wish for - nobody knows when they will become true... Following the story you can see development of relationships between characters. They get answers to questions, but they just birth new ones and new problems.

AoT is a brilliant anime with an unforgettable plot. The plot explorers friendship, will and importance of staying human, even when the whole world is against you. Unlike many other series, this one is unusual and you won't see the same story anywhere. Every season is very emotional, and some episodes are really terrifying at times.

All in all, Attack on Titan gives you memorable story with plenty of twists and turns. From the beginning, it attracts attention. I can't recommend it enough and have no doubt that you'll enjoy it.",10,2,"May 16, 2022"

10,BEST. SHOW. EVER.,"Attack on Titan is a show that starts simple and keeps expanding as time goes on. When people say everything matters, they mean EVERYTHING. Every twist in the plot makes sense with the narrative, a narrative that keeps expanding. Characters are amazing and get some of the best development I've ever seen. Even side characters get their own stories fleshed out and it truly feels like nobody is left to the wayside.

The anime just throws down thrill, action, emotion and much more. Things just get heated up every second. A lot of twists and turns which adds up much more heat. It's worth to spend some time watching 'Attack on Titan'. For sure after watching this, you'll be proud calling yourself as a fan of Attack on Titan.

10,THIS SHOW BROUGHT ME BACK FROM A DARK PLACE!,Never had I been invested in a story that much. Credit of which goes to the author Issayama who presented this story in an exceptional manner. Each season got better then the previous one. I expected this show to be the typical anime where the protagonist gets stronger and defeats stronger rivals (which i didnt mind as I even at that point considered it a great show). But the plot twists kept on getting bigger and better. The plot twists in the next seasons excluded this show from any other show in existence. Now i wont disagree that every show effects an individual differently. But if someone watches this show spoiler free and without any boas this show is definitely the best TV show in history.,10,2,"Sep 1, 2023"
10,One of the best show I have ever seen,"Truly amazing 👍👍 I am non anime fan I usually watch live action, but this show shocked me when I watched it I thought that anime was for kids And after seeing violence in aot I claimed that this anime is not for kids and has best action and emotion and now I am watching others anime too.

10,Objectively the best Anime.,"*No spoilers*

This series is incredible in every way so I'm going to explain why it is so perfect and well done to me with 5 simple points.

First of all the characters, the characters are so realistic compared to 99% of others animes shows. They are so well written and so deep that they show near real emotion and make us feel great empathy for them at any moment of the show. My favorite exemples are Reiner, Grisha and Eren.

Next the storyline, the storyline is borderline perfect. When you create a story, you have to fit everything you want into something that is coherent, but Hajime Isayama literally created the story from the end to the beginning. So by doing that, he knows where to put the best things at the greatest time to make us feel the best emotions after that he insert so much insane foreshadowing that it makes us think ""how did he think of that?!"". The best exemple is literally the first scene with Eren.

Then we have the themes, the themes of Attack on Titan are really philosophical and make us wonder about anything. Some themes are really impactfull and can even make you question yourself, some of them are freedom, betrayal, war and even power.

Soundtrack, the soundtracks of this show is like NOTHING else. We got orchestrals bangers for literrally every emotions we can get. This show know how to hype you with good musics or else make you cry. I'm objectively saying Attack On Titan got the biggest number of great music in the Anime world, I have a list of 30+ Aot soundtracks and my personnal favorite are ""Vogel im Kafig"", ""Call of Silence"" and ""Bauklötze"".

Finally we have Voice acting, the voice acting in this show is so damn good in any language. The voice actor in this show are literally playing the role of their life, we can even think they're giving everthing they've got. When it goes to freaking sad scene or to insane hype action the voice actor don't miss, in fact some of them are only recognized with their role in this show. My favourite and who I think everybody should have in their top 5 are Erwin, Grisha and Eren.

There are so much to talk about this Masterpiece like characters developements, actions, animation or PLOT TWIST, but it's just to show how great this show is and how this show cover all in perfection. I recommend this show to anyone who like everything I said before.",10,2,"Sep 29, 2023"

10,Masterpiece,"Overall the best anime to ever be created

I feel the only reason why this is rated so low is because it's an anime, so many people just brush it off because they think anime isn't cool or smt.

The characters setting plot and everything abt this show is just amazing well thought out and just a visual masterpiece.

I loved the way how every episode pretty much answered a question then left a new question which kept everyone watching. Everything abt aot is just amazing and if u haven't watched it I highly recommend it.

This was my first anime I watched and I'm glad it was. A couple of my friends said they had ""bad first impressions"" so it made them not watch any anime shows. This made me want to watch anime because of the amazing scenes and so much more.",12,3,"Jul 10, 2023"

10,War never ends...,"Okay so ""Attack on Titan"" is probably one of the greatest things that was ever created in this world, and it's because it is a MasterPiece storytelling a ""Peak Fiction"", the characters, the animation, the music, the visuals, the world building everything... is just so perfectly done. But what is really the meaning behind ""AOT""? Well what the creator (Hajime Isayama) is really trying to tell us is that there will always be wars in the world, war is inevitable war never ends... no matter what happens in this world (our world) the end result is always war. Yeah that's one thing I've learned from ""AOT"" but another thing that I've learned from ""AOT"" is ""Freedom"", the whole concept and the whole thing about ""Freedom"" in ""AOT"" is what makes this anime so great and why I love this series so much. I already know the ending of ""AOT"" and I'm scared that not everyone will really like it or understand it, understand the beauty in it, and yeah Isayama could have made a better ending but you can always make something better. Isayama even said himself that he doesn't really like the ending and that it's bad and he even said that he copied the concept of ""AOT"" from a book he read, but for me it doesn't matter because ""Attack on Titan"" is a perfect storytelling and a great pure piece of art.",12,3,"Sep 23, 2022"

10,"One of, if not, the best anime of the 2010's.","When I first showed this series to a friend of mine, he was worried it would be an animated knock-off of The Walking Dead, as both are set in post-apocalyptic settings, albeit trading the man-eating walkers for gigantic monsters called Titans. And while AOT is advertised in typical Shonen fashion with an easy to digest premise of humans desperately resisting against an overwhelming enemy, the show very quickly deviates from that formula once questions arise about the true nature of the Titans (and the role that they must play in the greater scheme of things).

It is far more accurate to say that the driving force behind the show's plot is humanity's foray into a world shrouded in many layers of mystery, with each new revelation coming at the cost of many soldier's lives, reinforcing one of the series' motifs of sacrifice and giving meaning to those who died by continuing to carry on their will. It also brings out the suspense behind each of the action sequences, as no character, not even the main cast, is safe from the cruelty the world has to offer them.

I would also be remiss not to mention how phenomenally WIT Studio animated the show with expansive backgrounds and detailed character expressions, or how great Hiroyuki Sawano made the soundtrack to amplify the emotion behind each scene, ranging from sublime majesty to pure chaos and horror. The voice acting in both Sub and Dub is top-notch, with my favorite actors in each being Yuki Kaji's Eren Yeager, capturing the animalistic ferocity of the show's protagonist who keeps moving forward no matter what lies in his way, and Matthew Mercer's Levi, who nails the blunt and battle-hardened personality of humanity's strongest soldier flawlessly.

10/10 experience watching this show, was not satisfied watching it once so I watched it 5 more times, and the details in the show are so well-laid out I learned something new every time I watched it again.",12,3,"Jun 17, 2019"
10,Greatest show of all time,"Greatest piece of cinema of all time.watching this from it first came out in 2013 to finally seeing this masterpiece end it brings more than tears to my eyes it also brings comfort to my soul.

This was perfect after years of waiting for another season then waiting for the finales and always being satisfied and over the moon with what was being displayed in front of my eyes and listened to by my ears.

I was afraid my favourite piece of cinema was ending as there would be no joy of next time or checking tweets and blog posts to find release dates of the next episodes or ova's but to my surprise I was happy, happier than words could explain thank you isayama for the greatest story ever told it was perfect to every last detail.",12,3,"Nov 7, 2023"
10,Beyond the Walls: The Struggle for Freedom in a World of Titans,"""Attack on Titan"" isn't just an anime; it's a revolutionary masterpiece in storytelling, animation, and thematic depth. This series doesn't just tell a story - it weaves a complex tapestry of human emotion, existential struggle, and a relentless quest for freedom against the most horrifying odds.

From the first episode, you're catapulted into a world where the stakes are unimaginably high, and humanity's survival hangs by a thread. The visual storytelling is nothing short of cinematic brilliance. Every frame is meticulously crafted, with animation that sets the gold standard for the genre. The design of the Titans is a stroke of genius - grotesque, towering, and terrifying, yet imbued with a strange sense of tragic humanity.

But the true soul of ""Attack on Titan"" lies in its characters and the profound narrative. Eren Yeager is more than just a protagonist; he's a symbol of the raging human spirit fighting against the oppressive cages of reality. His journey, along with characters like Mikasa and Armin, is one of brutal growth, heartbreaking loss, and a relentless quest for truth.

The storytelling is a masterclass in plot development, laden with philosophical undertones and rich symbolism. Phrases like Mikasa's ""The world is cruel but also beautiful"" transcend mere narrative. They don't just encapsulate the duality of the characters' reality - a world torn apart by Titans and yet capable of profound beauty and human connection - but they also echo the fundamental dichotomy of all existence. This line, and many others in the series, reflect a deep, universal truth about the world we all inhabit: it is a place of stark contrasts, where beauty and brutality, hope and despair, coexist in a delicate, ever-shifting balance.

This story is about confronting harsh realities. It's about understanding that the world is full of cruel contradictions. We face betrayal, loss, and the ugliness of humanity's desire for power. But in the midst of this cruelty, there's also beauty - moments of genuine connection, friendship, and sacrifice for the greater good. In this brutal world, our actions and choices become our defiant response to the question of life's meaning.

""Attack on Titan"" transcends the boundaries of anime. It's a philosophical journey, a commentary on the human condition, and a mirror to our own world's struggles with freedom, oppression, and the gray areas of morality. The soundtrack alone is an auditory spectacle, enhancing every scene with its epic orchestration.

In conclusion, ""Attack on Titan"" is more than an anime - it's a seminal work of art that will be remembered as one of the greatest storytelling achievements of our time. A breathtakingly beautiful and cruel journey that leaves an indelible mark on its audience.",12,3,"Nov 19, 2023"

Attack on Titan definitely has a few flaws here and there, like any anime or show have, but the things it do right are simply unmatched by anything, going above and beyond to provide one of, if not the most thought provoking, deep, complex, emotional journey available in any media.

And what a journey it was.

Even the super-power stuffs in it will all be explained and it's not just some story which has a OP character or underrated character that will at some point decides to be more active and boom.

9,Anime is not repeated and stuck in the mind.,"(9/10)

Attack on Titan is one of the best, most wonderful and Japanese anime that I have ever watched.

The music was wonderful, especially when you hear it in the middle of the events, or the music of the introduction and the end , the music was simply a masterpiece, writing the events smart, complex and understandable at the same time and requires great patience, a crazy scenario in every season, I loved the innovation in the anime and the serious dialogues and deep philosophy in this Anime, many details in one episode that make you feel like you swallowed a very heavy meal.

The problem with this anime is that sometimes we find procrastination in the events and many dialogues in the middle of an action event, but this does not happen often and I did not find it bad at all.

I enjoyed every second of this anime and loved it a lot. I think that this anime deserves the fame it got, the high ratings and the revenues as well. This anime is of course a masterpiece, an integrated work and a competitor to anime and series that entered history if this anime is the best.

If you have not watched this anime, I strongly advise you not to waste your time more and watch it as soon as possible, do not rush to the anime episodes too much because you will see something that exceeds expectations much and is definitely worth your time.",19,7,"Aug 8, 2021"

10,Gold Standard of Anime,"Season 1 review: There aren't a lot of animes which can boast of rivalling Game of Thrones or Walking Dead when it comes to standard of Storytelling. Set in the medieval European era, Humanity is almost made extinct by their natural predators, The Titans & Mankind has made their last stand behind three impregnable walls. The show is extremely gruesome, heart wrenching, and full of despair. Characters die left, right and center & most of them are scared out of their mind & spend their final moments in extreme agony which very much reflects real life war situation. The animation is extremely well done and has a unique feel to it, emphasizing on the faces to express their suffering. The action is just insane here, the camera angles & movement tracking makes your heart pulsate. The story is full of high moments & crazy twists. The intro outro songs as well as background score are some of the best in the industry. The voice acting is bang on & most characters stand out and are given depth. An absolute masterpiece which narrates human suffering and celebrates the indomitable spirit & resilience of Humanity.

S 2 & 3 Review: After the harrowing ordeal in the first season, its time for the Dreaded Truth to come out. Season 2 & 3 shows us the Scout Regiment's effort to recapture the lost grounds and in pursuit of discovering the secrets that will turn their world upside down. Season 2 focuses on the dark secrets held by members of Eren Jaeger's squad and Season 3 gives focus to Internal Politics of the Kingdom and the true history of the world gets revealed. Once again the Action sequences set the Gold standard in the Anime Industry, the storytelling and the emotions conveyed in these fights are truly unparalleled.

No anime will replace aot at any point in the near future. There's not a solitary time squandered in AoT, not a solitary filler. There's not a solitary melodrama digressed from the fundamental plot. AoT never veered off from its subjects and messages. AoT flaunts an extraordinary and monstrous troupe of characters and remarkable animation, and probably the best moments in anime at any point recorded.

10,Incredible,Attack on titan isn't just one of the greatest animes it's by far one of my favourite shows.

10,The Best Anime/Show Ever Created Period.,"To have a truly amazing show alot of area's have to be strong and luckily for Attack On Titan it excels in characters, story, plot twists, voice acting, animation, and music. One of my major issues with anime is the childish humour that the majority of anime like Dragon Ball Z, Naruto and 7DS all have but luckily for AOT it keeps it to a minimum like once or twice every 6 or 7 episodes whereas the others I have mentioned do it several times in each episode. Also it will all be completed in less than 100 episodes unlike some of the longer animes that go over 300 episodes.

Characters - They are all strong including the females you do not get silly characters like Bulma, Chi Chi, Elizabeth and Diane for example. Mikasa is a very strong female lead. And the way some characters be killed off? I never ever saw it coming, in this anime when a character dies you truly feel it unlike DBZ where they can be brought back to life with the dragon balls as a get out of jail free key.

Story (Plot Twists) - Some of the best I have seen in any show. The 1st episode is shocking and horrifying and then the plot twists (Warrior Episode) all have never left my mind. The foreshadowing is in its own masterclass nothing comes close.

Voice Acting - Erens voice actor is amazing alot better than his roles in 7 Deadly Sins and Others. The way he screams and becomes all hysterical in Season 2 Episode 12, he literally lost his voice due to that episode what other show can say that? Levi's ""Kenny"" scream and Erwins ""Soldiers Rage"" are also some amazing examples of voice acting.

Animation - The effects used when Levi battles at the start of Season 3 Episode 1 and 2 is amazing, The visual effects stunned me when he dodges all attacks. Yes its not about planets being destroyed or whole moutains and making massive craters like DBZ but the fights put goosebumps on your arms.

Music - from Season 1 intro to Sasageyo not to mention others like the new Friendship theme and Ashes From The Fire from season 4, no anime has music like this I mean I had to get the soundtrack. Hiroyuki Sawano is a legend and Kohta Yamamoto is definetly his disciple because the season 4 soundtracis brilliant.

Better than DBZ, 7DS, Naruto, Jujutsu Kaisen and even Demon Slayer in my eyes.",7,1,"Aug 31, 2021"

10,Undeniably excellent storyline,"Guranteed NO SPOILERS.

I have watched and read the series and manga till the end. The creator, Hajime Isayama, looks like he already knew the overall story plot since the first chapter its published. The conflicts are all related, just like when we watch Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood, but this one I think has more amazing complicated problem. After a few episode you watch, you will know that this story can not end with only a sad ending or only a happy ending. I love how the story kept our curiousity along with our time enjoying every episodes. This series' final episode/season deserves to be made in a movie. Anime is not only for kids now, this one is trully a masterpiece. This anime series is also reccomended for everyone who doesn't have the interest in watching anime, or starting to like watching anime. If you think that you are too late to watch this series, this one is masterpiece, and focus on enjoying every scene/episode. Attack on Titan, or i prefer saying Shingeki no Kyojin, will live for all time in our heart (haha). One the bothers me until now is, the title shouldn't be Attack on Titan, but Attacking Titan/The Attacking Titan/Attacker Titan.",7,1,"May 17, 2021"
10,10/10 story,"The way all the characters have been shown,their backstory and how all the characters have their own importance in the anime is just way too good. Must watch anime. You won't regret watching this one. Hajime Isayama is a legend. My favourite character is definitely Captain Levi Ackerman. He is the coldest character in this anime. The animation, the effects,the sound ,everything is just on point. The cinematics really make you feel like actually going to some place like the one shown in the anime. The critical analysis behind every Titan is so interesting to watch. Truly one of the most creative works ever.

Really grateful for having such artists.",7,1,"Mar 19, 2023"
10,Fantastic!,"There isn't a doubt in my mind that Attack On Titan is one of the greatest TV shows ever created. There are SO many things that I like about this show that I don't know if I can explain them all in one review! Nevertheless I will try. The soundtrack is absolutely amazing! It contains some of the most blood pumping, chilling, and epic music tracks I have ever heard in a piece of media! The animation is gorgeous and brilliantly captures the beauty and danger of Attack On Titan's world. The action is fast paced, dynamic, and horrifying with there being moments throughout the series that will make you cheer, cry, and gasp in terror! The characters are all unbelievably well realized with every person in Attack On Titan's increasingly enormous cast being multi-layered, likeable, enduring, and most of all, utterly badass! Eren Yaeger, Levi Ackerman, and Mikasa Ackerman in particular are some of the most awesome and entertaining characters I have ever had the pleasure of watching! The show's story is also MUCH more complex than it appears at first glance, and the show quickly becomes FAR more than a simple story of humans fighting monsters. In fact, at times the plot can even come off as too complicated for it's own good! However, for the most part, the story is very coherent and keeps you looking forward to discovering all the various huge secrets and plot twists that the show has in store. Overall, Attack On Titan is undoubtedly a masterpiece of television that should be seen by everyone, even by those who aren't fans of anime.",7,1,"Jan 24, 2022"

10,10/10,"The series initially began as a show about humankind fighting titans. However, as the story progressed, themes such as violence, discrimination, politics, and freedom emerged within a much deeper, more complex, and twisted plot. It is both action and dialogue intensive, brutal yet subtly elegant. It is thematically rich, resonant and symbolically profound. The amount of subtle detailing, unpredictability, parallelism through out the series is crazy and incredible. The plot, plot twists, plot progression, themes are masterclass and one of the best imo, complex mc, diverse and deep/rich side cast, masterfully synchronized/executed scenes, smooth animation, one of the greatest soundtracks in anime and many more brilliant aspects.",7,1,"Dec 24, 2023"

10,Incredible show - from someone who dislikes like anime.,"In these reviews all I hear are the people who a huge weebs, who only like those type of shows (and that's ok). But if you're a person looking at this show, wondering if it's good even though you may not like anime or if you do. Read this review.

Story rating: 10/10 The show's premise is phenomenal, it has incredible storytelling that really draws you in from the second you watch it. It shows the characters lives, the worlds layout, so perfectly it's insane. The unique universe and storyline just says it all. As well as the protagonists and antagonists are given great reasons for who they are, and why they came who they became. It also gives the audience an option to stan any side (bad or good side) based on who you agree with. This is only ever shown in one other show (that I know of so far), which was game of thrones.

Cinematography: 9/10 When I say cinematography, I mean the detail they put into each frame. And the detail in the early seasons were a 20/10. Istg real life action wasn't as good as this. Even if I saw it in real life, I feel that the show's quality would've been better. Though, in the later season, after they (I think) changed studio, it wasn't as good but still great!

Should you watch?

Yes. Even if you dislike these shows or don't have time, it will be worth your while. I couldn't stop rewatching after I finished, and I didn't expect I would like an anime in my life. I give it a good 10/10.",7,1,"Mar 20, 2023"

10,A Gripping Tale of Humanity and Survival,"""Once we kill our enemies across the sea, will we finally be free?""

""I'm not a big anime fan, but my friend recommended Death Note and Attack on Titan. I started with Death Note, but then decided to watch Naruto instead. I'm wondering why I chose Naruto over Attack on Titan. After finishing Naruto, I began watching Attack on Titan, and I must say it's the best anime I've seen so far.""

Thanks to the heavy rain in Gujarat and the Janmashtami holidays, I was able to binge-watch the entire Attack on Titan series in just five days. It's safe to say that Attack on Titan is The Greatest Anime Series Ever Made, and I'd rank it second only to Breaking Bad.

Attack on Titan (Shingeki no Kyojin) stands as one of anime's most monumental achievements, blending intense action with profound thematic depth. Created by Hajime Isayama, the series first captivated audiences with its stunning art, compelling characters, and thought-provoking narrative, all set against a backdrop of dystopian survival.

The series is set in a world where humanity is on the brink of extinction due to giant humanoid creatures known as Titans. These behemoths prey on humans, leading to the construction of enormous walls to protect the remnants of civilization. The story follows Eren Yeager, along with his friends Mikasa Ackerman and Armin Arlert, as they join the military to combat the Titans after a devastating attack on their hometown.

What sets Attack on Titan apart from other anime is its intricate world-building. Isayama paints a bleak reality where fear, sacrifice, and moral ambiguity pervade every decision characters make. The evolving lore of the Titans, the origins of the walls, and the conflicting ideologies of the characters create a rich tapestry that keeps viewers engaged throughout its four-season run.

Character arcs are one of the series strongest points. Eren Yeager's transformation from an impulsive youth seeking revenge to a complex figure grappling with difficult ethical choices is a central theme. Other characters, like Mikasa and Armin, offer unique perspectives on strength, loyalty, and the costs of freedom. The series also introduces an array of antagonists who are not merely evil but possess their motivations and backgrounds, contributing to the moral complexity of the narrative.

At its core, Attack on Titan explores heavy themes such as freedom versus safety, the cyclical nature of hatred, and the complexity of human relationships. The series delves into the responsibilities of power, showing that the quest for peace can lead to devastating consequences. These themes resonate on a personal level, prompting viewers to reflect on their own beliefs and choices.

The animation quality is stellar, particularly during action sequences. The fluidity of movement, dynamic camera angles, and attention to detail depict the intense battles between humans and Titans, which are both exhilarating and horrifying. The soundtrack, composed by Hiroyuki Sawano, amplifies emotional moments and action scenes alike, leaving a lasting impression.

Attack on Titan transcends traditional anime tropes, offering a narrative that is as intellectually stimulating as it is entertaining. Although the series touches on themes of despair and loss, it also inspires hope and resilience in the face of overwhelming odds. Whether you're drawn in by the intense action or the deep philosophical questions, Attack on Titan is a compelling, must-watch anime that is sure to leave a mark on its audience long after the credits roll.",7,1,"Sep 14, 2024"
10,"Peak fiction, Just watch this masterpiece before you die","I started watching this show to judge, to see if it was really worth all that hype and trust me when I say this, all my expectations were blown away in the very first episode, I cant name any other show that got me hooked like crazy in the first 15 minutes of the very first episode, this show begins with a perfect pace and till this day they managed to keep the pace as perfect as ever, the only show with no ""bad"" would be the biggest understatement, this show has no non-hype or filler episodes, and every episode is filled with little details and a lot of foreshadowing, Its beyond impossible to guess what will happen next and every episode will keep you excited from start to finish. Every episode gives you something to desperately look forward to. The story telling, the action sequence, the characters, even the side characters that barely gets any screen time has better storyline than the main characters of other big movie franchises , dialogues, voice acting and the soundtrack oh the soundtrack, stunning soundtrack and audio editing, perfect use of the soundtracks and plot twist in every 3-5 episodes, each season unveils larger than life mysteries and it just gets better and better, Don't do the mistake of ''its just an anime'' because I guarantee its beyond anything you have ever watched, season 4 part 2 is going to be banger.",7,1,"May 17, 2021"

The unique concept of Titans, towering humanoids that devour humans, and humanity's struggle to survive within walled cities created a sense of urgency that kept me on edge throughout the series.

The character development is one of the most impressive aspects of ""Attack on Titan,"" with each character having their own compelling backstory and motivations.

10,Too good,"I didn't expect this series to unfold into an amazing story telling narrative. What started as a mere action thriller quickly jumped into a politically chaotic and complex yet beautifully structured story. Damn the storyline is too good; way too good. Attack on Titan is by far the best anime to ever exist. For me it is the greatest anime of all time (coming from a weeb who has watched Naruto, Demon Slayer, One Piece, Hunter x Hunter, Bleach, Monster and many more). Other anime are also good but if I had to choose one which tops all then it is definitely AOT. The music, the visuals are on point. The action is well packed. Everything is good especially the music man omg what a soundtrack even Hans Zimmer would be proud. Touches you to the core of your emotional state. Okay okay I'm so excited to even write this review. I'm out of words to describe how good of an anime it is. Go watch it if you haven't. You'll have the best time of your life.",7,1,"Mar 7, 2023"
10,Changed anime forever,"This is the anime you recommend to people who've never seen anime. It really changed the perspective of what anime can do. No overused and unnecessary fan service. No plot armor, no filler. I hope a lot of anime will adopt this in the future.

It doesn't feel like an anime, but it couldn't be anything but anime if you know what I mean.

Literally everything makes sense in this story and nothing goes to waste. You need to pay attention to everything. The story comes full circle and it's just... *chef's kiss*. This show should be up there with the greatest titles. This goes far beyond just anime.

I just feel like it's all pointless, but at the same time, it's the only way to conclude everything. I understood where they're coming from and why it has to be done that way, but I can't find the will or way to just accept it as it is; it's not easy.

All I know is that this series is something that I didn't expect to have a great impact on me. I just watched it for the sake of feeding my curiosity, but I'm glad that I did. The storytelling is mad genius, but it's a painful kind of genius. It plays with emotions and intellect. In simple words, I guess it grounds us with the idea of what it's like to be a human in this morally challenging world that we live in. It's not always sweet, but it's definitely not always bad. Everything depends on how we see things and what actions we take to manifest that reality.

But overall, I'm still wishing for a different conclusion, one where everyone that we rooted for in this journey gets to have a life as joyous and peaceful as they deserve, together with their cherished someone, an unending one, especially.",7,1,"Aug 13, 2024"

The soundtracks are a masterpiece and you most likely will download them. Another amazing thing about Attack on Titan - there isn't anything ""forced"". There isn't anything placed inside here just to please some groups of people. In fact it doesn't take your feelings into account and it makes it even better.

One eg - in first episode when Erens mom tells Mikasa that ""this boy has to be protected from himself"" which sums up the whole series.

**No spoilers** I vividly recall the buzz surrounding the anime ""Attack on Titan"" a decade ago when its first season aired. Initially, I found it good but not groundbreaking. Little did I know that this series would evolve into an absolute masterpiece, defying expectations and cementing itself as one of the most compelling shows in recent memory.

The series begins with a seemingly straightforward premise, but it swiftly spirals into a complex and riveting narrative. Season 3, in particular, stands out as the pinnacle of the show, delivering mind-bending plot twists and unparalleled story development. Just when you think the stakes couldn't get any higher, ""Attack on Titan"" throws another curveball in its fourth season, leaving viewers on the edge of their seats.

Having initially underestimated the show, I now consider ""Attack on Titan"" a work of art. Its ability to subvert expectations and delve into intricate lore is unparalleled. Some critics argue that the ending falls short, but I beg to differ. I believe the conclusion is a fitting and perfect end to a series that thrives on complexity.

As I reflect on the journey from the first season to the last, it's evident that ""Attack on Titan"" has not only lived up to the hype but has exceeded it. The show's ability to evolve, surprise, and maintain a high level of quality throughout its run is a testament to its status as a true masterpiece in the world of anime. ""Attack on Titan"" has proven that time has only enhanced its brilliance, and it will undoubtedly be remembered as a landmark series in the history of anime.",11,3,"Nov 16, 2023"

10,Great Anome,"Amazing. Lots of plot twists, very unpredictable. Many characters with interesting backstory. However, it is very bloody, has lots of violence, and pretty much every side character dies like a horror movie. As long as you're fine with that, this tv show will be great.",9,2,"Aug 22, 2021"

10,I became a new man after watching this!!!,When I was younger I have never watched an anime. I always thought anime was wierd and creepy (coz some of them are). One year ago two of my friends suggested that i should start an anime. I immediately refused. Then they said that i had to watch Attack on titan. Before that point i have never seen or heard of AOT. We went to one of my friends house and we started watching. I was not interested at first but I beacame more curious every time we met and saw more episodes. After finishing it I was in the world of AOT. The only thing I could think about was AOT. My opinion on anime (not all) flipped. Really pls suggest this show to your anime hating friends because I was one of them and look now. (this was my first ever review).,9,2,"Aug 13, 2021"

10,The show that defined a generation!,"This show will forever earn a special place in my heart, as well for anyone who watched this show since 2013! This was an experience.. a journey.. an era that will be remembered for decades!

First i want to makr it clear that you do not need to be familiar with anime to enjoy this show! I say that cause Attack on Titan was my first anime and therefore the introduction to the medium! I discovrred anime because of this and it ended up defining my life!

This show might seem simple and straight forward at first, but as the show progresses it gets more complex with huge twist and turns you could have never predicted, that will leave you shockwaved, but still feels organic and natural! The writing and story is next level and having seen the ending, it felt like the endgame was decided from the beginning!

The characters are amazing, especially Eren Yeager who turned into one of the most complex and well written characters in TV media history, along with the likes of Walter White from BB!

Action qnd animation is AMAZING! Multiple sequences will leave you breathless! Delivers something you can only find in this show!

The soundtrack is INSANE!! One of thr best soundtracks i have heard in an animated show, yeah in just any show! Its like Star Wars where the music blows up, even if not much is happening!

If you have not watched this show.. DO IT!! This is not something we are gonna witness again for a LONG time! Its not just a show.. its something that will leave a deep impact in your memory forever!

Thank you AOT for being such a huge part of my life!",14,5,"Nov 14, 2023"

10,Greatest storytelling of all time 🙌🙌,"Do I even need to say anything about this show. No other show even comes close to the storytelling and foreshadowing of Attack On Titan. And till this remains one of the greatest piece of media ever created. The amount of concentration you need to have to spot the hidden details of the show is much higher than any other show. The animation switch from WIT to MAPPA was also very good choice in my opinion due to the anime switching to a much darker tone. The plot twists are outstanding, literally taking the story to a whole new level. And the characters are brilliantly written. Till this day, Attack On Titan remains one of the greatest piece of media ever created.",4,0,"Nov 4, 2024"

Then just as I was thinking it will never get better than this, in the year 2017 while s02 part was live for AOT I watched s01 it was never same again. My taste for anime grew along with passion and respect for the creators. After GOT final season it felt good things don't end well but AOT s04 till now proved wrong it can get better and better and better .

10,You know its good when your dad watches it,"Title says everything. This show is the greatest essence of anime. There is almost nothing bad to say about it. The plot, character development, voice acting, and damn the music hit hard like nothing else. Theres so much to learn from Eren's actions throughout the entire story. This show still gives me the chills even after 5 years.

Oh someone said the ending is trash? These are the very guys who don't understand the entire message of Attack on Titan. The ending was perfect as it is, albeit depressing. War and revenge never achieves anything as the cycle will continue and never stop. Stories dont always have a happy ending and we must accept it. It is also about love, the sacrifices that one will make for their friends.

Warning: It is not for the simple minded. There is layers of deep meaning embedded into the show that made me question alot of things. Not recommended if you can't think emotionally.

Absolute peak fiction.",4,0,"Feb 2, 2025"

Everything about this show is amazing and I am currently waiting for season 4 coming out this year and I just wanna say watch this anime even if u don't like anime you won't regret. When watching the first episode In 2015 I was scared as hell and my heart was beating fast.like just imagine seeing your own town getting eaten by these scary titans and your running to your house to see if your moms fine but she isn't and she gets eaten by one right in front of u.",4,0,"Jan 10, 2020"

10,EPIC...EPIC..EPICCCC!,"Attack on Titan is nothing short of a masterpiece, blending intense action, intricate storytelling, and deeply human themes into a gripping narrative that transcends the anime genre. As someone who isn't usually immersed in anime, this series felt astonishingly real-a near-life experience that pulls you into its chaotic, heart-wrenching world.

The story begins in a dystopian setting where humanity is on the brink of extinction, confined within massive walls to shield themselves from the terrifying Titans. What starts as a simple survival tale soon unravels into a complex web of political intrigue, moral dilemmas, and philosophical musings on freedom, power, and humanity's darker instincts. The plot twists are expertly paced, leaving you on the edge of your seat, often questioning your assumptions about heroes and villains.

The animation quality is jaw-dropping, with meticulously crafted battle sequences that are as breathtaking as they are brutal. The fluidity of motion, the attention to detail, and the sheer scale of destruction make every moment visually stunning. Coupled with a phenomenal soundtrack-featuring epic orchestral themes that perfectly match the emotional intensity-it becomes an immersive sensory experience.

The characters are another highlight. They are flawed, layered, and intensely relatable, grappling with impossible choices that challenge their morals and beliefs. Eren, Mikasa, and Armin's evolution is both tragic and inspiring, mirroring the series' larger themes of growth amidst adversity.

What truly sets Attack on Titan apart is its ability to provoke thought. It doesn't shy away from exploring the gray areas of war, loyalty, and sacrifice, making it more than just an action-packed series.

For fans of storytelling that challenges conventions, this anime is a must-watch. Even if you're new to anime, its universal appeal makes it a nearly transformative experience. Attack on Titan isn't just an anime; it's an epic.",4,0,"Nov 23, 2024"

Through the story, you can live dark times and reflect on the horrific wonders of the world.

Attack on titan is spot on in making an evolving plot with enough backstory for characters. Its just so beatifully crafter story. You nevew know how the story unfolds next.

Music composition, its truly awesome. To get the despair and moments into the music is point on.

Anime lover, its a story I come back to. Its different from others. Its a masterpiece. The dark times reflect the creator, its fresh and new.

About the visuals, even though its made a while back with the first episodes. The animation is awesome, lively and detailed. From episode one you wil feel chills in your spine. Just let the story take you in a another dimension. Love from Finland.

Just love it 10/10.",4,0,"Oct 18, 2024"
10,Watch Date: unknown (sometime in 8th grade) Have since rewatched,"I first watched Attack on Titan in the 8th grade and here I am a 20-year-old woman that is still an avid fan of not only the anime but, the manga and spinoffs series as well. As a 14-year-old girl, I fell in love with Armin Arlert and for Christmas, I received the Armin Arlert Figma action figure which I still have to this day. In fact, I am writing this review while sitting next to my shelf full of expensive Armin figurines, plushies, keychains, bracelets, hell even a face towel. I love this show and I LOVE the characters. Hajime Isayama created a world that is immersive and real. With intricate and interesting lore and a breathtaking plot line, I am not surprised by this anime's success.

10,Greatest show I have ever watched,"I'd say this is the greatest anime I've ever watched, but I'd be lying. Honestly, this is the greatest show I've ever watched. I was biased against Attack on Titan for years before a friend managed to convince me to watch the first episode. By the end of the ~25 minute long episode, I was already in tears. It took me around two to three weeks after that to completely finish the entire show - I was hooked from the first episode alone. Attack on Titan has a superior run of episodes; each episode has its own significant contribution to the plot and each episode does justice to the episodes that come before and after it.

The plot of this show is incredibly thought out and detailed. Many people discuss the subtle foreshadowing used in Attack on Titan, which is only noticed by the viewer after the first or second rewatch. I'd like to mention that not only is the foreshadowing spectacular, but the plot, the characters, the setting and the animation is also superior to any other anime - and most other general TV shows - I have watched.

Despite the plot truly coming to life towards the end of the third season, AoT remains a show that I can rewatch from the very start every single time. The story of the first three seasons is incredible, and when we learn all the new information exposed to us about the world of AoT, the story only gets better and better. In the fourth season, new characters, new plot, new settings and even old characters are (re)introduced to us, the viewers. However, this overload of information doesn't come across as overwhelming and the show continues its impeccable storytelling and animation, which changes subtly in the fourth season, and becomes something the show can pride itself on even more.

As to not give too many spoilers, my review will end here. But I promise that anyone planning to watch or rewatch Attack on Titan will not be disappointed by this show - the plot, the characters, the messages, the animation, the foreshadowing; everything deserves a ten out of ten when it comes to AoT.",4,0,"Nov 10, 2024"

I had heard about this anime and wanted to watch it since a long time but was dicey whether to go ahead. I was into the story right from the first episode. The animation is seamless when it comes to reaching the Titan to killing it.

The story feels like it is happening surrounding you and you have a tear in emotional scenes as well as pumped in the action scenes of this anime. A must watch if you are an action fan",4,0,"Apr 17, 2020"
10,"The best anime, possibly the best show I've ever seen","I just started watching the series when the fourth season launched. I wasn't hooked immediately, the first half of the first season is relatively slow-paced and builds up a lot of characters, some of which I admittedly didn't care much for initially. But once the series picks up speed and momentum around the later episodes of season 1, it never loses it. It keeps you engaged with well set up promises and incredibly rewarding payoffs. Both Japanese and English voice acting is stellar, the soundtrack is good and manages to support the important scenes while never taking too much space. The animation does have some bad moments, especially in season 3, but they aren't dealbreaking.

Fast forward to season 4, and the show has basically changed genres, and it has never been better. In retrospect, every single scene matters. Every character is fully fleshed out. There are very few exceptions where a character seems motivated more by plot than their own goals, but that is negligible next to the varied cast of characters who go through incredible development. Nothing is wasted. The show knows how to deliver both heartwarming and hopeful victories and crushing defeats, and they hit hard. I can't wait to find out how it's all going to end.",4,0,"Mar 9, 2021"

Characters are descent , not extraordinary but the story does holds them off. The twists are really unpredictable at some points. Overall it's totally worth the time spend behind it.

10,Perfect,"*Attack on Titan* is a gripping and intense anime that stands out for its unique storyline, complex characters, and philosophical depth. Set in a dystopian world where humanity is on the brink of extinction due to giant humanoid creatures called Titans, the series delves into themes of survival, freedom, and the morality of war. The plot is filled with unexpected twists and deep, often dark, explorations of human nature and society. The animation is top-notch, with detailed and dynamic action sequences that keep viewers on the edge of their seats. The character development is another highlight, with protagonists like Eren Yeager, Mikasa Ackerman, and Armin Arlert evolving in profound and often heartbreaking ways. As the story progresses, it reveals intricate layers of political intrigue, moral ambiguity, and the true nature of the Titans, making it a thought-provoking experience. The soundtrack, composed by Hiroyuki Sawano, perfectly complements the intense atmosphere, adding to the emotional impact of the series. Overall, *Attack on Titan* is a masterful blend of action, drama, and philosophical inquiry, making it a must-watch for any anime fan.",4,0,"Aug 24, 2024"

10,An absolute fantastic series,"Attack on Titan is an absolute masterpiece of anime, deserving a perfect 10/10. From its intense, gripping storyline to its complex characters and breathtaking animation, the series delivers on every front. Set in a world where humanity is on the brink of extinction due to the terrifying, man-eating Titans, the plot constantly evolves with shocking twists, keeping viewers on the edge of their seats.

One of the show's greatest strengths is its intricate narrative. What begins as a simple survival story transforms into a deeply layered tale of politics, morality, and the nature of freedom. Each season adds new layers of complexity, with revelations that reframe earlier events in fascinating ways. The character development is equally compelling, especially with protagonists like Eren, Mikasa, and Armin, who undergo profound transformations throughout the series.

Visually, Attack on Titan is stunning. The fluid animation during high-octane battle scenes, especially those involving the vertical maneuvering gear, is some of the best in anime. The score by Hiroyuki Sawano is equally iconic, adding emotional weight and intensity to every moment.

What truly sets Attack on Titan apart is its fearlessness in exploring dark, philosophical themes about power, war, and humanity's survival. It's an anime that makes you think while thrilling you with its high-stakes action and jaw-dropping plot twists.

With a perfect blend of storytelling, character depth, and visual excellence, Attack on Titan is a must-watch for any anime fan and deserves a full 10/10.",4,0,"Oct 13, 2024"

There is just something special about Attack on Titan, in a way it feels like you're there with the characters in their desperate attempt upon uncovering the truth about the cruel world they live in. The fantastic characters, the clever dialogs, the perfectly selected music that elevates all of the important scenes and the overall art and atmosphere combined with the foreshadowing already shown at the start of the series is what makes this show stand out so heavily in my eyes.

10,Visual Masterpeice,"OMG this series blew me off course. I am fairly new to the world of anime since I've been watching for less than a year, but despite that, I feel as though I've stocked up quite a list so far. Attack on Titan I can say was one of the first I came across besides Dragon Ball and My Hero Academia and a couple other TV 14 small series, but man was I blown. Considering that this was the first anime that had a TV MA rating that I watched and being new to the anime community, it really propelled me to seek out more like it. The series has outstanding visuals and storyline that will make you hungry for more of what's next. This anime instantly became my favorite. The soundtrack I listen to all the time. It is a bloody masterpiece that will get you hooked once you start watching. The 3D maneuver gear is awesome as the characters are flying on screen, and Studio Wit really does a fabulous job with the animation which really stands out in the action scenes. And you really get attatched to the characters. Everyone is a red flag. Everyone can be eaten by the titans. And everyone has to fight for their lives in order to survive. Plot twist after plot twist. Devastation after devastation. Shock after shock. I truly love this anime and fell in love with it by the first episode. The series really deserves the hype that it gets these days. If you aren't into lots of action with killing giant basically naked people (without any explicit private areas--like a crash test dummy with a face and hair I like to think of it) with people on the brink of extinction and stellar animation and sound to go with it, then you might not be a fan of this anime, but if you are...go for it. I guarantee it will be to your liking in one way or another.",4,0,"May 15, 2020"
10,IT'S LIKE GAMBLING.,"Attack on titan is basically Kakegurui of anime. Watching it feels like cards are being thrown on table one after another each exceeding another. Some time like a poem connecting everything from first line to last with every line containg its own special meaning. Like science unraveling the mystery of world and history created by hajiyama, connecting 10 years to today to connecting 2000yrs to today too. Flowing like river smooth yet destroying everything in it's way yet nourshing everything. Relativity is understoodable by it 4 months in show felt like 10 years and 9 years in reality felt like yesterday. Every emotions swelling after each scene each dialogue it's a same that this hype will end someday.",4,0,"Feb 7, 2022"

9,A Colossal Achievement in Anime,"If you've ever doubted that anime can hit the heights of masterful storytelling, Attack on Titan is the ultimate counterargument. I gave it a 9/10, and trust me, it's not just because of the hype, it's because this show delivers a narrative that's as epic as it is intimate.

At first, it seems like a straightforward survival tale: humans battling Titans to protect what's left of their world. But oh, how wrong you'd be to stop there. This series peels back layer after layer, revealing a web of political intrigue, historical lies, and moral dilemmas that leave you questioning everything you thought you knew. It's like unboxing a puzzle where every piece fit, but only after you've turned it around a hundred times.

The characters? Complex doesn't even begin to cover it. Eren's evolution is wild. He's not just a protagonist; he's a symbol, a paradox, and sometimes even a villain, depending on how you look at it. And then there's Mikasa, Levi, Armin, and the rest of the cast, each bringing their own shades of gray to a story where no one is fully right or wrong. You can't help but feel attached, even when their choices leave you conflicted.

Visually, the show is a feast. Those ODM gear scenes where characters zip through the air? Absolute brilliance. The fight choreography is sharp, but it's the quiet moments-the haunting shots of ruined landscapes or the sheer terror of Titans looming in the distance-that stick with you. The animation team brought their A game, and it shows.

So why not a 10/10? Honestly, it's the kind of show that can feel a bit overwhelming at times. The story is dense, and the exposition can occasionally slow things down. But even then, it's a minor hiccup in an otherwise monumental series.",4,0,"Jan 27, 2025"

10,A Modern Classic,"Attack on titan was the anime that brought me into the magnificent world of anime 5 years ago. Don't get me wrong i had watched shows like Pokémon and Yu-Gi-Oh before but lets be honest who hasn't watched those. So all things considered one might say that i am emotionally attached with Aot and thus my judgment is rigged because of that. Nonetheless, the fact remains that aot is such a goated anime. On the surface and for some people it may seem that its just about a banch of people getting brutally eaten by some naked human-like giants. In reality tho, its about human nature and relationships, it is about the will to survive and be free , to explore the unknown and about politics and the consequences of wars and the endless cycle of hatred that comes with it. It is about people fighting so hard for their ideologies and convictions only to find out that that reality isn't always black and white, in fact most of the time it's gray just like real life. There aren't any spiteful or evil characters in this show everyone is the hero in their own story. There are so many things i could say about this anime i could write for hours if possible and still wouldn't sufice. All in all, for me attack on titan isn't just a great anime it may be one of the best tv shows to ever exist and yes it may sounds outrageous but trust me i dont take those words lightly. I would definitely suggest this anime to anyone with an open mind that doesn't mind too much gore. MASTERPIECE.",4,0,"Feb 2, 2021"

However, I recommend you not watch it from a casual perspective, this isn't something you turn on in the background while making dinner in the kitchen. There's no episode that doesn't have a major plot that leads to the climax. You will be hit with a sledge hammer In the face with revelations when you least expect it.

This is entertainment at its peak, it doesn't get better than this. Get comfortable, grab your favourite snacks, and a handkerchief, you are going to need it. Enjoy the ultimate journey through the eyes of a child that grows to see it all. ""See you later, Eren.""",4,0,"Nov 5, 2024"
10,Attack on Titan: A Masterpiece of Modern Anime Storytelling,"Attack on Titan is nothing short of a cultural phenomenon that has redefined the very essence of storytelling in the anime world. Its gripping narrative, complex characters, and moral dilemmas set against a beautifully horrifying world are just the tip of the iceberg that makes this anime a standout.

The series opens with an intensity that hardly ever lets up, but what truly elevates Attack on Titan is how it constantly evolves, diving deeper into its richly constructed universe. As layers are peeled back, the stakes grow higher, and the lines between good and evil blur, challenging viewers to question their own moral compass. The pacing is masterful, striking the perfect balance between action-packed sequences and moments of quiet reflection that make the experience unforgettable.

The characters are written with immense depth and emotional realism. Each person, whether a protagonist or a minor character, contributes to the overarching narrative in a way that feels meaningful and impactful. Their development over the seasons is organic and compelling, reflecting the show's thematic exploration of freedom, sacrifice, and the human condition.

Visually, Attack on Titan is breathtaking, blending jaw-dropping animation with a hauntingly beautiful score that enhances the series' most thrilling and heart-wrenching moments. The action scenes are visceral and intense, and the animation fluidly captures the sheer terror and majesty of its world.

Whether you're a seasoned anime enthusiast or a newcomer to the medium, Attack on Titan delivers an unforgettable viewing experience. It transcends typical anime conventions, offering a thought-provoking narrative that lingers in your mind long after the final credits roll. Simply put, this is a story that will be discussed and celebrated for years to come-an undeniable masterpiece of storytelling that will leave you breathless.",4,0,"Nov 11, 2024"

I also love how there is no fanservice at all! not a single scene, if there was this anime would be almost perfect, but there isnt, so thats truly amazing considering almost every mainstream anime nowadays have at least one. I love how well the characters are written, you can see that the creator puts the character before women. Most animes put women before character, which makes the woman often leaning to her feminine side, and most of the time are also weaker. The body proportions are also not overdone and actually look realistic. I am sorry for breathing the same air as everyone who has worked on attack on titan.",4,0,"Jan 21, 2021"

Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood, Deathnote, Cowboy Bebop, Monster. People are hating it because they dont want to like another anime more than the one they love. I have seen Game of Thrones, Vikings, Archer, Fargo, Friends, Mirzapur, Paatal Lok which I love with all my heart. Game Of Thrones on 2nd, Mirzapur on 3rd, Archer on 4th but Attack on Titan on 1st for a reason. The story, dialogues, animation, the plot twists (Oh God the plot twists!) the thrills.

10,AN UNEXPECTED MASTERPIECE,"Everything about this show is amazing! I was skeptical at first, but after watching it, I was genuinely blown away. I ended up introducing the show to my brothers and turned the self-proclaimed anime-haters into fans overnight with this show (not that they had even seen an anime before). Now they are calling this show the greatest on earth. I am inclined to agree.

It's got lots of great stuff, especially its surprisingly mature, nuanced, and realistic exploration of human nature. Its greatest strength is perception. Your perception of events, characters, and the world is constantly made to change. It's one of the few shows that you will appreciate a lot more the second time you watch it because it is set up and planned so well, even though you will rarely be able to guess the big twists despite all the evidence being present. It is also one of the few shows that I have seen which shows different sides of humanity realistically with a full awareness of its themes. There aren't super clear-cut good guys; there are certainly bad guys with good qualities and some good guys with bad qualities. It's very realistic in that respect. One theme throughout the show is sin (even on a generational level), and how all people are sinners, especially when it comes to war. It shows how these actions affect later generations and how the children are often made to suffer for the sins of their parents. It is one of the shows that tends to get people into anime, with good reason. Animation, art and music are beautiful as well. It also asks lots of interesting philosophical and moral questions, such as the possibility or impossibility of breaking the cycle of hatred and violence, how and why the oppressed often become oppressors, what is human nature, the influence of propaganda on society, the dilemma of possible genocide, and war, etc. It's a masterpiece. Also, do not assume after watching the first season that you know basically how the rest of the show will go because it most definitely will change. In other words, if you do not like the first season, keep on watching because you might like later seasons.",4,0,"Nov 9, 2024"
10,AMAZING ANIME,"Though this anime isn't for kids, it's still a great anime for adults to watch. The anime can be extremely graphic at times like suicide, murder, and eating people alive.

10,Masterpiece,"Attack on Titan is a masterpiece. No other word can describe it. Let me come to each point one by one. Story is unique,you will not find any movie or series who has story like this. Very detailed even a small things matters a lot in its story.Full of mystry ,suspence ,twist and turns, you will never be able to know where will the story go next

It's action scenes are awesome . Attack on titan has the best use of CGI among all anime. This scenes are so well animated that even a random schreenshot will make a good walpaper. Every fight will give you goosebumps at least one time

Characters are very good and large in numbers and with every character you will connect differently. Even some side characters will become your favourite (#leviisbest)

Emotional scenes are very well directed ,not a single emotion of any character is suppressed. You will feel the fear of characters on seeing the Titans .

It's strange that I cannot find any cons in this series. It is highly recommended.

Thank you",4,0,"Feb 2, 2021"
10,"Attack on Titan isn't ""overrated""","Even if i may seem basic but Attack on Titan was the anime that introduced me to the world of anime, making me belive is worth watching.

I've watched many psychological films that left me thinking, ""What just happened?"" or ""What does this mean?""-movies that blew my mind and sent me searching for deeper interpretations online. That kind of experience.

This show managed to shock me too in a way I didn't expect. Initially, I overlooked small scenes that were actually foreshadowing and assumed the show was mainly action-driven, centered around the classic ""How do we escape the Titans and live freely?"" plot.

It wasn't until late into Season 2, heading into Season 3, that I realized-I was in for a hell long of a ride.

I honestly don't understand the hate for this anime, especially from people who either dislike the idea of titans and feel the need to call it ""overrated"" without even watching a full episode, or from those who simply didn't grasp its depth-or understood it only after reading thousands of explanations online but let their ego tell them it's just ""mid."" And then, of course, there are those who have never written a single piece of fiction in their life, yet somehow feel entitled to call the author's work trash and dismiss it entirely.

Anime isn't about competing over which series is the best. It's about storytelling, about evoking emotions, about making you feel something. It's about learning, about seeing the world through the author's eyes.

And Attack on Titan delivers on all of that. It's intense, complex, and filled with characters that are unique, well-developed, and deeply connected-not just to each other but to the core themes of the story.

As for the controversial ending-people sending death threats over a fictional story is beyond pathetic. This is the ending the author chose. Who are we to challenge that? Instead of respecting the art for what it is and appreciating it as a whole, some people would rather complain that it didn't align with their personal expectations. Sure, I might have wished for a different outcome too, but I can understand the reasoning behind it.

At the end of the day, reviews fueled solely by personal emotions projected onto others shouldn't exist in such an extreme way.

For me, Attack on Titan has no major flaws. It's unique enough to stand out, and it deserves all the credit it gets. So thank you, Isayama, for sharing this masterpiece with us.",4,0,"Feb 7, 2025"

10,Anime lover,I firstly did not like animations but i was drawn to Anime when i started to watch anime with good story lines. Am old but i resonate with the story line of this animaton. It shows us passionate people and how villians can try to ruin their lives but they stand still in their humility and conquer at the end. I have been taught that being good pays and it doesnt take away anything from you. Thank you for this amaing animation it teaches a lot. I will surely share this with my young boys who love anime to watch it and get some valuable lessons they can really help them in their lives. Thank you for this amazing Anime.,4,0,"Dec 27, 2024"

However, I can confidently say that Attack on Titan captivates from the very first episode with its unique and compelling storyline. There isn't a dull moment; each episode is packed with suspense and action. While it may come off as a straightforward fantasy series, it delves into significant themes like freedom. Plus, the soundtrack is so powerful that it evokes a sense of patriotism for a fictional world. The character development throughout the series is impressive, enhancing the emotional stakes and making viewers deeply invested in their journeys. The stunning animation and intense fight scenes create a visually striking experience that heightens the overall thrill.

10,One of the best series I've ever seen.,"Honestly, this is one of the best animes I've seen, like ever, it's intense, emotional, fun and lots of unique characters and a pretty good plot.

(most people rating low in recent days (in 2022) are annoyed cos AOT jumped to No.2, after Breaking Bad at No.1) IMO ignore them, and watch it for yourself if you like intense action, emotional roller coasters and a good story line.

Hajime Isayama really knows how to write a great manga, and MAPPA knows how to animate amazing shows, the use of CGI/3D and 2D in the last two parts of season 4 make it unique in a way.

Literally 10/10 or even more. It's worth the watch, I highly recommend it.",4,0,"Jan 26, 2022"

Make sure you watch the sub in Japanese, so intense. Shinzo Sasageo!",10,3,"Jun 12, 2019"
10,G. O. A. T,"Attack on Titan is one of the most epic and exhilarating anime series of all time. It delivers a thrilling and emotional ride that will keep you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. The animation is stunning, the music is powerful, and the voice acting is superb. The characters are complex and relatable, each with their own strengths and flaws. The story is rich and unpredictable, full of twists and turns that will shock and awe you. The themes are deep and relevant, exploring the nature of humanity, freedom, and morality in a cruel and unforgiving world. Attack on Titan is a masterpiece that deserves all the praise and popularity it has received. It is not only a captivating and entertaining show, but also a thought-provoking and emotional one that challenges the viewers to question their own beliefs and values. It is a must-watch for any anime fan, and a great introduction for anyone who wants to experience the best of what anime has to offer.",10,3,"Nov 22, 2023"
10,Best thing I have ever seen,"Best writing i have seen ever.

10,There is nothing like Attack on Titan,"Attack on Titan has an impact like no other. It's hard to find the words. From the very beginning to the very end, it never ceased to amaze me. One of the greatest pieces of fiction ever made with a very understandable and profound message. It is hard to move on from it now that it is over. There will never be a show that will match this. There were so many reveals and twists and traumatic moments that completely astounded me. What will always stay with me are the characters I grew to love and appreciate. The amount of character development and growth we get to see is crazy for one show to succeed at for as many characters as it did. There is not one badly written character in the shows entirety. There is not one aspect of this show that I dislike. I will miss the emotions and feelings I have had while watching this show and am sad to say goodbye to it. I will definitely be rewatching this show for the rest of my life. Shinzou wo sasageyo!",10,3,"Nov 7, 2023"

10,One of the best shows of all time,"Reason why Attack on Titan is one of the best shows of all time 1. Amazing plot ( For me it's the best story I've ever seen)

2. Unique fight scenes ( Odm Gear fight scenes and titan fights)

3. Very good Characters(Eren ,Mikasa, Erwin Smith, Annie,Reiner,Zeke ,Jean......) And character development (Eren's character development is marvellous)

4. Each and every episodes is too good (unlike other Animes each episodes are story rich and heavily engaging lots of things happening in every episodes)

5. Music

6. Plot twists (I've never seen better twists and turns like this)

7. Way of Storytelling

8. Symbolism And insane Foreshadowing

9. Themes (freedom, war, the beauty & cruelty of the world, Racism the necessity of sacrifice,betrayal, trauma and a lot more)

+S4 Eren.

Only problem is, it's anime ( Not for me but for most of the people's )Even though it's a fictional world, it's nice to feel like a part of something and to choose sides like Eren's side or rest of the world /alliance.",10,3,"Feb 26, 2023"
10,Intense. Brutal. Emotional. Amazing.,"Attack on Titan is not your everyday anime. People die in this show and the good guys are always at a disadvantage. There are no superpowers or magic stuff. It's an all out brutal war about tiny humans versus the Titans, huge humanoid and seemingly brainless creatures.

The humans however, do have a fighting chance. Using grappling hook and steam powered jets, they zip and fly through the air like Spiderman on drugs. During these sequences you can't help but marvel at the beautiful animation. In fact, the entire show is so goddamn beautiful. The visuals are full of lush, warm colors with detailed backgrounds. They change to fit the mood of the scene, but never stray into dull, monotonous grays. This is all supported by a gripping, truly memorable and larger than life orchestral soundtrack which is the stuff of legends.

The story about a young boy who is out for revenge on the Titans for killing a relative together with his foster sister and childhood friend isn't anything special in the beginning. But plenty of mysteries start developing right away and the show does an excellent job about keeping the viewer guessing.

The world is beautifully realized and everything is well thought out. Mankind has built 3 enormous circular walls to protect itself from the Titans. Social struggles are in full effect when the rich are living in the luxury of the inner circles, while the poor fight for their lives at the edges of the outer rings. When the army leaves for an expedition on horses, the formation and system of communication they use is explained in every little detail that matters. There is nothing in this series that feels out of place, because everything is so consistent. Always sticking closely to the rules the author of the original manga created.

The top notch visuals, mysteries and legendary soundtrack pull you in, but it's the various plot twists and turns that keep you guessing. Just when you think the show is turning cliché, it turns 180 degrees and truly SHOCKS you as a viewer. Certain events in episode 5 and 21 in particular, had me staring at my screen in disbelief. The violence is brutal, but never over the top and it's always used to good effect.

This show is truly one of the most intense watching experiences I have ever seen in my life. Even when characters are just talking. Or giving speeches. Or doing just ABSOLUTELY mundane stuff like putting on their uniforms...you can always feel the suspense thanks to brilliant harmony of soundtrack, camera perspective and all kinds of neat visual touches. No to mention the strong voice actors.

By now you must be asking: are there any negatives then? And of course, there are. The number one is the pacing, that can sometimes be seen as out of whack. Episodes 3 and 12 in particular, could be cut or shortened considerably for a better viewer experience since so little actually happens.

The characters are likable, but for the most part do not develop a whole lot in this part of the overall story (this being Season One). I did not mind it a lot, because the world and it's mysteries take center stage either way. The characters that do get development are also pretty good and get lot's of screen time.

In conclusion, I can only call this a masterpiece. The emotions are intensely conveyed, the world is believable and full of mysteries, the story has many twists and turns, the character remain absolutely human in their struggles and the soundtrack and visuals are both hauntingly beautiful.

I would recommend everyone, regardless if you like anime or not, to watch the first episode. I will guarantee you, you WILL be hooked.",16,7,"Oct 1, 2013"
10,A triumph in storytelling and it so happened to be an Anime.,"This series from start to end exemplified flawless pace, profound storytelling, engaging characters, beautiful animation and a fantastic score. It's easy to judge AOT by its cover and think it's another fantasy-driven series but it's much more than that. AOT deals with rich themes that equate to our world today. It challenged me to appreciate life more in a war-driven society and to not take for granted the minute details in our lives that bring us joy. Those details are what make life living. What a beautiful gift that is even in a broken world.

10,Rare Anime,It's rare to see an anime that comes along and sweeps the viewer off his/her feet. Attack on Titan checks all the boxes. Definitely worth a Binge.,8,2,"Aug 12, 2021"
9,Untouchable,"I was sceptical about this one. I was sceptical about Anime in general. I really thought that i wouldnt find the art styles and expressions generally used in Anime appealing. I thought that it wouldnt take itself seriously. Personally, i like shows and movies with a serious thematic and consequences. Something gritty, somewhat violent, powerful. I thought that Anime cant be serious and cant tell good stories. I was wrong.

Attack on Titan is brilliant at displaying a creative world, with so much lore and history. When they show you the walls, the villages, the green fields, everything breathes with soul and character. Beautiful art and visuals. You look at all these people, minding their business, living a peaceful life, being happy. And then, it gets destroyed. The peace breaks, the cheers and laughter turn into screams. Everything crumbles. It would be easy to give up facing all this terror. But do the characters give up? Do they let themselves be defeated by the enemy? No. They fight back. Some with unimaginable rage and passion, some by intelligence, some by creativity, some by weapons, and some by hope. And when you see these characters struggle, overcome a far more powerful threat, you realise that you are hooked. You cheer for them as they prepare for their next battle.

Sometimes you think to yourself: ""Well, i guess this is over now"" and just when you think that you got the story figured out, Attack on Titan changes the game on you and now, you have no clue what is going on. Very few things can surprise you as much as this Anime.

I struggle with analyzing Attack on Titan and finding any real flaws to it. A lot is going on and there are lots of emotions and stories to figure out. Every character has some motivation and something drives them towards their goal, be it good or bad in our eyes. This Anime never bores you and always keeps you guessing.

After finishing The Final Season Part 1, i can say with confidence that this is probably the best thing i have ever watched so far, and that i am going to have a hard time with finding a better Anime than this one. Extremely excited for Part 2, hope it comes sooner rather than later, and i hope that you give this Anime a chance.",8,2,"Mar 30, 2021"

10,Attack on Titan is my favourite anime of all time.,"Attack on Titan storyline, character development,character design,animation,the main protagonist everything is just so great.

Eren Yeager is the protagonist and my most favourite character in Attack on Titan because he is so cool and his character development is the best thing for me in this show. There aren't so many animes that have a Main character like Eren Yeager. I also like Levi,Mikasa,Erwin,Jean. Floch etc.

Attack on Titan is an anime that have the potential go and write down in history. Attack on Titan is one of the best anime in this world. There are so many hidden details in Attack on Titan.

I am not ready for the end of this anime. This anime is very emotional. This anime will teach you that even a fictional animated show can make you cry. You will definitely get emotional after watching this show and if you don't than you have a stone heart.

Attack on Titan story can be complicated sometime so you need to pay attention very well when you watch this anime. But if you still don't understand than just watch some youtube videos where many people explain Attack on Titan story very shortly that you will understand.

And this is the reason that Attack on Titan anime is a Masterpiece. If you don't agree with me than just watch it and see for yourself. If you understand the story of Attack on Titan anime than there is no reason for you to dislike it.

I want to thank Hajime Isayama for giving us this Masterpiece.

If you have read this much than thank you as well.",8,2,"Sep 21, 2023"
10,Just The Best,"Attack on Titan is an incredibly intense and gripping anime series that has garnered a massive following worldwide. The story takes place in a world where humanity is on the brink of extinction due to the emergence of giant humanoid creatures called Titans, who devour humans for pleasure rather than sustenance.

One of the standout aspects of Attack on Titan is its well-developed and intricate plot. The mysteries surrounding the Titans and the walls that protect humans provide a constant sense of suspense and intrigue throughout the series. The show is filled with surprising plot twists and revelations that constantly keep viewers on the edge of their seats and craving for more.

In addition to its engaging storyline, Attack on Titan also excels in its character development. The main characters, particularly Eren Yeager, Mikasa Ackerman, and Armin Arlert, go through tremendous growth and transformation as they confront the horrors of the Titans. Their emotions, motivations, and internal struggles are expertly portrayed, making them relatable and adding depth to the narrative.

The animation and action sequences in Attack on Titan are top-notch. The battles between the humans and the Titans are intense, brutal, and visually stunning. The animation captures the scale and power of the Titans, as well as the desperation and determination of the human characters. The sound design, including the hauntingly beautiful soundtrack, adds to the overall immersion and impact of the series.

However, Attack on Titan is not without its flaws. Some viewers may find the pacing of the story to be slow at times, especially in the earlier seasons. The series also contains a significant amount of violence, gore, and dark themes, which may be off-putting for some viewers.

Overall, Attack on Titan is a must-watch for fans of dark and gritty anime. Its intricate plot, well-developed characters, intense action sequences, and stunning animation make it a standout series that has rightfully earned its place as one of the most popular anime of the past decade.",8,2,"Aug 29, 2023"

10,A Must Watch Show You are an Anime Fan or Not.. Arigatou Isayama,"You don't have to be an anime fan to watch AoT. I have watched tens of anime series starting from One Piece, Naruto, Bleach, Hunter x Hunter... ect. I have never ever thought to write a review here about anything but AoT has forced me to. I don't exaggerate a bit if I give it above 10 because it does deserve it. How can for a human being brain to write such a story full of twists that you think in the first glance that it only evolves around titans who eat human beings but its messages are deeper than that.

I watched Breaking Bad and Dark and I love them especially Dark. If I love AoT more that doesn't mean that I give less credits to Naruto or One Piece or any other series like Breaking Bad as lot of people because they favor a series over another, they rate AoT with 1 or 2 and that can be seen in the AoT Finale episode.

I know one for sure, AoT is uniques, masterpiece and, in short, incomparable.

I am writing this review and I am still having that big void the Finale did to me.

Trust me or give it a try just 1 ep. And if you reach to ep5. You can't stop it. Storytelling is insane, Especially the plot twists, all I can do is ""oohh yeaaaah""

And one thing this anime doing great is the song they play during scenes, it makes me feel like watching cinema.

I give this show a 10/10 for all the creators in every position, you all deserve it.",8,2,"Sep 12, 2023"
10,one of my favorite anime...this the anime which made me cry,One word for attack on titan.. masterpiece 🔥🔥👍👌 nd idk why other people's think that this anime is overrated.,8,2,"Aug 7, 2021"
10,This show proved me wrong,"I always said that anime is a crap and other stuff, but this series is too good that it is as god tier as Breaking Bad. This should be the ""real"" Game of Thrones, not the actual BS we got instead with that awful story. I am proud to say that this show changed my opinion over animes in general. I must admit that the only annoying thing are the moments when characters are overreacting their ""baby crying"" scenes, I mean just be a man and stop crying but nvm.",8,2,"Feb 20, 2021"
10,I had never watched a anime like this,Oh my god anime is greatest a perfect anime to burst your mind.,8,2,"Aug 10, 2021"

10,BEST ANIME EVER,Do yourself a favour and go watch it. It doesn't get better than this.,8,2,"Jan 14, 2021"
10,Cinematic Greatness,"This show is the closest thing to perfection for a tv show. It has genius storytelling with mysteries with unreal payoffs. Tells a mature story that goes into religion, race, war, economics, politics. Along with A+ animation and sound.

I can't name one show better than this masterpiece. This as close to flawless as you can get.",8,2,"Oct 31, 2019"
10,Probably the best anime/drama in a century,"Growing up watching lots of Anime in Japan, I can honestly say that this is by far the best anime and I am so glad and honored to be alive to witness the 10-year-joining of this master piece.

The storyline itself created by the genius, Isayama-Sensei is worth watching but anime is out of the world thanks to the creators like WIT, MAPPA, voice actors and composers, Hiroyuki Sawano & Kohta Yamamoto.

AOT is a dark fantasy but it reflects our world where we are living in beautifully and tragically.

You will need to watch them a few time to fully understand and enjoy the series as the plot of this is so complicated and deep.",8,2,"Sep 27, 2023"

10,My favorite show,"This series hooked me from the first opening, where I found a song with a unique style. The first few episodes introduce you to the world in a way that you experience many emotions and go from excitement to sadness and anguish. Although I consider the first season the weakest, it still has one of the best introductions I have seen. Each season gets better. From the end of the third season and throughout the fourth season, we can see Eren trying to find solutions or alternatives to an inevitable fate, and finally deciding to turn away from everyone. This is a sad and heartbreaking journey for our characters. Although I would have liked a little more personal interactions between these characters (filling), it is made clear what roles they fulfill.

Overall, Attack on Titan is a very solid series throughout and one that everyone should watch and enjoy.",6,1,"Jan 1, 2024"
10,Well written,"I like many things from this show. It keeps you interested in its story,mystery and the charecters.. im glad it was not plain hero beats villlain. The complexity of who is the real villain and what is their goal is always being questioned .. its brilliant. Since i came into it late i had to watch all at once and i didnt think and feel through it all enough.",6,1,"May 31, 2019"
10,MASTERPIECE!!,"Attack on Titan is my favorite anime and serie tv of all time; don't trust people that say that anime don't count because they are bad and all repetitive, they probably didn't watch anime as AoT, Full metal alchemist brotherhood, death note... These shows need to be watched. Returning to AoT: this show is amazing, it is taken by the manga of Isayama and it has all the good things of the manga: It has fantastic action, that make you want to stay there to ""fly"", investigate, ride with them and that makes you hold your breath and make you drop your jaw especially for the fights between titans and between men and titans; A raw story that makes you understand that no one is invulnerable, everyone can die, even without anyone knowing, without anyone seeing that you are making a sacrifice, but also that there is no good or evil, just that there is a perspective or way of saying things that influence your vision. Also I like the way he deals with topics that are, and always will be, hot, without being boring or out of place, or without sounding like a lick.

I love this anime with all my heart, the way Isayama told us the story without leaving anything out and the glow ups of the carachters and their natures. The first three seasons are already astonishing, but the 4th seasons is something else. Unfortunately I decided I didn't want to give spoilers, because otherwise I would have gone on for much longer. I have only one word to describe this show MASTERPIECE!!

10,Absolute Excellence. Ecstasy. No words can do justice.,"Attack on titan is not just one of the greatest anime shows of all time, it's one of the greatest and most remarkable works of art/entertainment PERIOD. I seriously cannot put it into words what this show does to you as a viewer. This anime captivates you in every possible way imaginable. Amazing storyline that just gets better and better with each episode. They do an amazing job developing characters and the relationships between the characters. You as a viewer begin to feel a connection with each of the characters and feel for them and the greatest thing about that is that the show does not hold any punches when it comes to the fates of those characters. The music compliments the show so well and enhances every scene. The fight scenes will absolutely blow you out of this world. The intensity and viciousness of each battle is so epic, it will literally have you on edge and make your heart pound. Idk what it is about the fight scenes, but something about the sounds of titans feet stomping shaking the earth and the feeling that you're there in the battle gives you absolute goosebumps like you'll never experience watching any other show. The show is so unpredictable and will always keep you guessing. This show will make you forget any other show you've watched. Do yourself a favor and watch it.",6,1,"Jun 8, 2021"

10,Greatest anime of all time,You might as well not watch this if you do then you will never find another show better,6,1,"Feb 9, 2021"
10,This world...,"I can do a list of things I love about this story, and never end. It's hard, but I'm only going to highlight three.

1- The story. Not only the social and religious criticism, which is glorious. The plot from the beggining to the end its a compleatly masterpiece that reflects how ignorance and human stupidity can destroy the minimum ray of hope to build a world without hate, in which no life is more important than other.

2- The music and sounds (not only Soundtrack, that's pure fantasy). The characters voices, the sound of a rock breaking, of a step, of a blow, of a breath, a cry... things that bristle my skin.

3- The animation. Above all the epic action animation... the way of looking of every single character. No words.

And, for those who say: ""I don't like anime, is just unrreal, it dont make sense"" or one of the best that anyone tell me ""It's in japanese, if it was in my language..."". First, according to this last thing. How can you see a film or a serie in another language that it is not the original one, and even express your opinion? It's like give your opinion about a hamburguer while you are only eating the bread, dry, tough and rotten.

Secondly, for those who criticize anime for the simple fact that it's drawed animation, let me tell you something that can make you release about who and how you are. A person who can't appreciate the hard work, the music, the shots, the little and unique details like the colors, the sounds and voices, the faces and the reflection of feelings that probably any person can show and even don't know they feel, but over all, the infinite possibilities of creation... that's a soulless person. A person whose imagination is sunken in the deepest part of the Mariana Trench while in his mind there's nothing but reality, ""logic"" and a huge stone of petrified s***.

Sorry for my words and my probably spelling mistakes, and for those people that can never understand what they are missing.",6,1,"Aug 1, 2019"

The characters, the pacing, the plot, the world-building, the twists, the animation, the action, EVERYTHING, its just perfect. This show its made so you Never get bored, or get the feeling that you are watching empty content, because its so well built from the beggining, that you see that from the first episode, they start buildind the last one, and you get that feeling all the time while watching this.",6,1,"Sep 3, 2024"
10,Simply the GOAT,"If you are not a fanboy of any other big anime then there is a 90% chance that Attack on Titan will definitely be on your top 3 list, the anime is so great in many different aspects from the drawing to the animation to the soundtracks and the story itself, and no only that the anime is great only, the manga also is so epic and its worth it to read it.

The story will take you to the deep world of AoT that is heavily detailed and it starts with the big shock in the first scene where the colossal titan destroys the gate, from that moment you will start ask questions and try to understand the full secrets of the organized AoT releam, the characters development and relationships with themselves are built carefully and slowly with no rush, the concept of ""no one is protected, anyone can die"" gives that story a special sense or realism compared to the majority of animes where the good guys barely dies and when they do they are instantly replaced with other good guys to fill their gap, even though the anime is classified and rated as a shounen but its not at all a shounen anime, its a seinen from the story to the world and the type of visuals and fights type, its classified as shounen just to attract more people and air the anime on the shounen channels to get more views.

As of now (2019) studio WIT offered the best animation ever made in anime, this aspect have no comparison specially when we speak about the Blu-ray version that give the full experience away from the TV censoring.

The soundtracks is one of the greatest soundtrack of an anime with wide range of variety based on the scene and it get attached easily to the viewer head with the unique moment in the show.

The Manga is so great if you like reading and I would like to suggest the ""Colossal Edition"" which I had the best experience reading from and its great also for collectors, also you can check the ""Before the fall"" series if you are a big fan and want to know more details.",6,1,"Nov 18, 2019"

I put this at a 9 because even tho this show is so good being a ten is unreal by putting It as a 10 would mean this is the best show but that's not it.

10,This is no doubt one of the best shows of all time,"I understand if you don't like anime, or you think it's cringe, I understand but this show deserves a chance. It doesn't follow the average anime criteria, it is a dark, intense , gritty, engaging, and action packed. On the first episode (without spoilers) there are over four times it foreshadows the following episodes. The action is intense, there is no plot armor for anybody, if you are hit it is a realistic result. There is also no filler, every episode has something important and entertaining parts. The plot twists are every other episode. If your not watching for the amazing character development or action, watch for the entertaining and twisty plot. This show doesn't throw around violence just because, it makes everything intense and adds tension. Season 4 is a gem of a season on any standard. Season 1 has a semi slow start but picks up as it goes on. The characters have relatable motives, and amazing development. In all watch this show for it's uniqueness and engaging plot.

It's the greatest gift to humanity and an art that will never be forgotten in our history. I know I sound like I'm overreacting, but I really just want to commend Isayama for this. He deserves all the praise because his work is unbeatable. From the characters, the shocking plot twists, great conflict, and more.

Every single second of this show is jampacked as the show goes takes you on twists and turns that are actually impossible to predict. As the story unravels, events that were seemingly meaningless become key plot points as the entire story is revealed. This show brings new meaning to the word, badass.

After watching Season 3 Part 2, I thought the show could not get any better, but man was I wrong. The characters finally become everything we ever wanted and more! Additionally, Season 4 Part 1 has set up a finale to the story that will truly break the internet when it is released.

I am sure I will be back here when Part 2 is completed as the story will reach unimaginable heights. The show was riveting from episode 1 all the way to the end. Everyone, anime and non-anime fans alike, should watch this show.

Eren was right.",6,1,"Jan 11, 2022"
10,Possibly Greatest Anime of All Time,"Attack on Titan is the anime... no, it is THE show to beat. I think it may be the perfect show. The storytelling is masterfully done. For those who haven't seen the show yet, the giants are not the most important components of the show. The story is so much deeper and richer. Speaking from personal experience, it's a lot of fun to go back to previous seasons and witness plot points that I had a difficult time following make sense in the perspective of the latter seasons. I can't imagine it's easy to craft a narrative that asks the audience to hold on to the end to finally discover some answers.

On top of the incredible story, the action scenes in the show are just so damn fun! They are crafted in a way that convey to the audience how gigantic these titans are. The care put into the action scenes of this show, illustrating how dynamic and quick each character is reacting, does make a huge difference in how riveting it can get.",6,1,"Mar 8, 2023"
10,Greatest Anime I've watched this decade,No content,6,1,"Oct 9, 2019"
10,Just perfect,"Shingeki no Kyojin (Attack on Titan) is a critically acclaimed anime that has captured the hearts of many fans worldwide. The story is set in a world where humanity is forced to live within walls to protect themselves from giant humanoid creatures known as Titans. The show follows the story of Eren Yeager and his friends as they fight against the Titans and uncover the mysteries surrounding their existence.

The animation and visual effects in Shingeki no Kyojin are stunning. The attention to detail in the character designs, landscapes, and action sequences is remarkable. The music also adds to the overall intensity and emotion of the show, creating an immersive experience for viewers.

The plot is filled with twists and turns, keeping viewers on the edge of their seats. The characters are well-developed, each with their own motivations and backstories that add depth to the story. The show also tackles themes of war, politics, and human nature, making it more than just a typical action anime.

One criticism of the show is that it can be quite dark and graphic at times, which may not be suitable for all viewers. The pacing of the show can also be slow at times, with some episodes focusing more on exposition than action.

Overall, Shingeki no Kyojin is an outstanding anime that is definitely worth watching. It is a gripping and emotional journey that will leave viewers wanting more. The animation, music, and plot are all top-notch, making it one of the best anime of its time.",6,1,"Mar 4, 2023"

-They say slow, and in the first 8 episodes, the Titans appeared twice, and eren trained for 4 years, this is a simple example.

-They say the characters are bad: sorry, but isiama (author) does not like the strength of friendship, screaming or will. They say eren is weak and a lot of crying and they forget what he suffered, but why eren is strong in the fourth season 🤔?.

I'm not saying it's flawless, but most of the criticisms are untrue or ridiculous. AOT respects the minds of viewers, but some minds do not deserve that respect.",6,1,"Oct 7, 2021"
10,Just give it time u will love what it unveils..,"Season 1: I only loved first 15 episodes of this season after this until episode 20 it was a drag the pacing in season 1 was sooooooooo sloowwwww I actually stopped watching it. But then I began watching it again and after episode 21 I finished season 2 in one day. Season 2: This was better than season 1 in 2 aspects 1. Pacing 2. Storyline I actually got emotionally attached to the characters and everything in this season made so much sense. Although this is fiction but a lot of aspects are quite practical and unlike other animes people do die in here for real and never come back... Season 3: This season was diff from first 2. It was more like political conspiracy involved about how and when titans and other characters were developed. Back story is good and pacing is done well... season 2 and 3 are definitely binge worthy once u complete season 1. Beat overall character development was Erwin, Levi , Armin and I LOVE MIKASA ACKERMAN.",6,1,"Apr 5, 2020"

10,A handbook on intelligent storytelling,"THIS is how you write antagonists! I love how this show didn't even reveal the antagonists' leaders and motivations for a LONG time. Finally a series that actually requires attention to be able to understand the plot.

A story about sacrifice and gray morality which evolves boldly, without faltering in front of the shame of the abominable live-action Attack on Titan.

I only wish it surpassed the self-imposed shortcomings of the anime style. There's no need for every emotion to be expressed explicitly and then some.",6,1,"Apr 2, 2021"

This show really changed my life with it's characters and mainly the protagonist Eren Yeager.",6,1,"Feb 7, 2022"
10,"Stop down-voting this piece of art without even watching, hipsters.","The internet community is so stupid nowadays, people keep hating on anything that goes mainstream without even giving it a try before. This anime managed to revive this dead art of anime that has been publishing rotten immature sexualized garbage for 7-8 years or so, and these trolls that probably didn't even watch it keep down-voting it because they call older animes better, wth... What are you even trying to do, keep anime in the horrid state it was before this piece came out? After seeing the votes breakdown, I even suspect some multi-accounter repeatdly voting 1's on it (very low average from the US only, coming from a high percentage of 1's...) and an incredibly high percentage of 1's from the 'top 1000 voters'! (???). Seriously pin those trolls and ban them from voting here.

Well anyways, With the official themes of DARK FANTASY, TRAGEDY, and DYSTOPIA, This anime is not your average DBZ/Naruto/Bleach, this one is perfectly well done, written in such a manner that makes it deserve competing around with the best western live action series, be it an anime or not. Such a perfect balance of elements that make this series a masterpiece (I've watched it several times already, read the manga, analyzed it bit by bit, and it seriously is far more appealing than most of the old series you glorify just because they're old and they marked your childhood/adolescence), and as such it deserves a perfect score.

It is one of the only series I can keep watching again and again finding new meanings in every detail every time I watch it, as it throws hidden messages everywhere making reference to real world issues as well as teasing possible plot twists / reveals that makes your brain burn out trying to guess what will happen next, and when you get that reveal it only opens up more mystery. It also has such a crude way of portraying deaths, being merciless with its characters but always in a realistic way, since real deaths in a lost warfare like this will really be fast and furious, and AoT makes sure to make that clear. This series is a perfect mixture between GoT and Lost, with an additional godlike OST, visuals, and action sequences, and season 1 was just a tip of the iceberg in terms of the story and character development. But I guess we will have to wait some years so these idiots drop their skepticism and watch it without being blinded by their hipster instincts / frustrated non-mainstream anime fanboyism.",36,23,"Oct 8, 2013"

9,My impressions,"Note that I haven't finished the show yet. This review is basically for season 1 and 2. I have started season 3 and I'm enjoying it so far and it definitely feels it's building up to something

Anyway what can I say about Attack On Titan that hasn't already been said; the show is very close to a masterpiece. There is a lot to unpack but I want to keep my thoughts relatively spoiler free. A good place to start is the phenomenal premier, hands down one of the best I've ever seen. We instantly understand the situation and severity of a breach, the emotional ties between eran and his mum, and a look it to what's to come. This is mostly in form of spectacular animation and music, used effectively to the final scene Season 1 was very good, and caps of very well, but i still think season 2 is superior despite it being half as short. All in all, check this show out because it really is worth the acclaim. I'm excited for what's to come and to give this show (I hope) a well earned 10/10",12,5,"Oct 8, 2019"
10,Truly brilliant,"I'll cut to the chase, Attack on Titan is a masterpiece and one of the greatest TV shows of all time. I simply couldn't recommend it more.

The synopsis may give the impression that Attack on Titan is a relatively regular action anime - and it does also do the action anime stuff really well. However, not only does it subvert some action anime tropes, it goes far beyond a simple, hype action show (dare I say it is deep). It is mindblowing. I will write no more about its story because Attack on Titan is best experienced blind and without specific expectations.

ODM gear is a piece of equipment the characters use to move around like Spider-Man and it is one of the coolest modes of movement I've ever seen in fiction. That wouldn't be the case if it wasn't for the world-class animation. Attack on Titan is full of mesmerizing action sequences and epic shots, but the visuals are also amazing during the more quiet, peaceful moments. If you get far enough into the show, you will notice a change in its visuals caused by a change in animation studio. While this change is overall a downgrade (from great to very good), the new art style somewhat fits the latter parts of the series.

Attack on Titan's soundtrack by Hiroyuki Sawano is without a doubt my favorite out of anything I've heard. It really manages to elevate a lot of already iconic scenes into the stratosphere. Pretty much every track is a banger I listen to in my free time. This is by far my most subjective opinion though since Sawano's music essentially defines my taste. If you like music akin to Two Steps From Hell, I reckon you'll love Sawano's creations.

The voice acting is also superb and remains consistently superb throughout. Both the original Japanese dub and the English dub are some of the best dubs in their respective languages and I recommend both of them. If I had to choose, I would take the original Japanese dub, because it is the original, and is overall more consistent. If you have a hard time reading subtitles, you should carry no worries about picking the English dub.

In the end, there are no words that are enough to praise Attack on Titan. It is just THAT good. As with any show, it is not without its flaws (e.g. Plot armor) but those flaws are utterly minuscule compared to all the great things it has to offer. Ultimately, however, at the core of my 10/10 rating for this series is my intense emotional attachment to its story and characters. There is no emotion this series hasn't gotten out of me. I hope you will love Attack on Titan just as much as I do.

Lastly, a few IMPORTANT disclaimers regarding this series:",12,5,"Jan 24, 2023"
10,Truly greatest Anime of All time and i have seen,"Attack on Titan, a powerhouse in the anime world, has left an indelible mark on the hearts of viewers worldwide over the past decade. Created by Hajime Isayama, this series has elevated the medium, not just in terms of animation quality but also in its profound storytelling, character development, and exploration of complex themes.

From its debut in 2013 to its grand conclusion in 2021, Attack on Titan has consistently delivered a narrative rollercoaster, leaving fans on the edge of their seats with each episode. At its core, the series revolves around the remnants of humanity facing extinction due to giant humanoid creatures known as Titans. As viewers delve deeper into the narrative, it becomes apparent that Attack on Titan is not merely about battling monstrous foes but a canvas painted with political intrigue, moral ambiguity, and the resilience of the human spirit.

One of the most commendable aspects of the series is its character development. Over the seasons, viewers witness the evolution of characters like Eren Yeager, Mikasa Ackerman, and Armin Arlert from wide-eyed cadets to complex, morally ambiguous figures. The show does not shy away from showcasing the psychological toll of living in a world constantly under threat, and it beautifully illustrates how individuals grapple with their own humanity in the face of existential crises.",9,3,"Nov 21, 2023"
10,It's been almost 10 years.,"I remember the first time I watched AoT back in 2013. When I finished the first season, I used to search every single week for news about the second season. It took so long to get released, but I kept desperately searching. I knew how epic this story was gonna be, and now after four seasons, I can definitely say that it even surpassed my expectations by a great deal. I am the kind of person who enjoys a decent storyline rather than just getting bombarded by fights and action scenes. I surely enjoy them as well, but wouldn't they be much better if they made sense? If they felt deserved, and God, how effortless Isayama does that is ridiculously brilliant. Everything makes sense. Everything connects, and the satisfaction when you realize these connections is impeccable! Not only it does that, but it also delivers it with the PERFECT soundtrack, and I mean it. It's just perfect. How they develop to match the atmosphere of every season is marvelous. The character development is certainly earned, and the pace is just about right. It's hard to combine all these elements while maintaining a consistent level of excellence, and that's what makes AoT special. A masterfully written story that will forever remain one of the greatest of all time. I can't wait to see how the story unfolds in the next season, and no matter how the ending is gonna be, I would like to say: Thank you Isayama for this wonderful journey.",9,3,"Nov 23, 2022"
10,the best show ever made,"I honestly feel like ti deserves at least a 9,6 out of 10 on IMDb, but it's my review so I'm giving it a 10, absolutely incredible tv show that everyone, anime fans or non anime watchers can enjoy, the story gets better as it goes on and it constantly keeps you on the edge of your seat, truly incredible work of art.",9,3,"Jul 6, 2022"
10,Amazing!,"I've seen many many anime & I can easily say this is my favorite. It's one of those ones I couldn't stop watching. I give this 10/10 and highly recommend watching.

I don't write reviews in general, but it bothers me that people down vote this anime and other great shows simply because they aren't happy with the total user rating. For people to say this anime is 1-4/10 is beyond a joke. When you write a review of any show, the first step is to actually watch the whole thing so you can give an honest review. Second step is to rate honestly based on your opinion - To give a rating of 1/10 and rant about how 'over rated' it was is just ridiculous and nonsensical. Thirdly you can write an honest review to justify your rating that others can read and help them decide if they want to watch it, and/or engage in conversation.

Just because YOU aren't happy with the overall rating, doesn't mean its necessary to down vote it in some childish attempt to bring the rating down.

I am 33 years old and I've seen a lot of anime - this one is 10/10 for me, I watched the end of season 2 about 20 times, I loved it and can't wait for season 3",9,3,"Jun 27, 2018"

It's for a reason first anime ever with almost half a million votes here, it's easy to get 9.0 with 100k votes but with 500k it's another story, and boy is it a good one.

10,Attack on Titan is the most powerfully driven and hype inducing TV series to ever grace earth.,"Attack on Titan is epic. Everything this show does from its execution of a large scale plot of humanities struggle for survival to its small scale staging of scenes with appropriately epic dialog and use of a bombastically loud and emotional soundtrack exudes the meaning of the word epic. While from a broad perspective Attack on Titan's plot is in no way original as it could be compared to a zombie apocalypse story and while the major characters in the show tend to follow traditional character archetypes, what this show lacks in original character design or overall plot originality it makes up for it in its flawless execution, staging, and style. Attack on Titan cleverly leads its audience to believe it defies all general plot archetypes and stereotypes by regularly jarring the viewers expectations with abrupt catastrophic events. Every time the show seems to be going in a predicted direction something happens to throw it off course, it actually conditions the viewer to almost expect things to go in unforeseeable ways because it happens so often. So while from a macro level the plot looks generic and dry, the viewer experience watching the show is incredibly suspenseful and captivating. Attack on Titan has a way of consistently building up viewer hopefulness and excitement but then proceeding to crush all positive feelings in general while always leaving just enough hope to give its audience a reason to continue watching. Any emotion invoked by Attack on Titan is basically amplified tenfold and whenever the show seems to approach a less extreme place on the emotional spectrum something catastrophic inevitably happens rein-citing all of the seemingly subdued emotion.

Attack on Titan does a great job of establishing a driving force that propels the show throughout: the desire of freedom. The main protagonist Eren criticizes the complacency of humanity and his very spirit is the essence of freedom; Eren is like a caged bird with cleft wings fighting for his freedom and there is various symbolism in the show representing this: 3D maneuver gear, the scouting legion, and wings of freedom (the symbol of the scouting legion) are all symbolic of freedom while the walls and the titans symbolize the cage preventing escape. The constant driving force of a human desire to be free propels the series throughout its entirety and brings the question of ""at what cost must freedom come at?"" as every attempt of humanity to gain freedom is met with insurmountable casualties and failure.

The art in Attack on Titan consists of the characters being outlined in thick black lines which gives them a pronounced distinct appearance from the background. The backgrounds in this show are absolutely beautiful and upon watching the beginning of the first episode the incredibly detailed clouds in the sky and beautiful fields of grass particularly caught my attention. While the characters have thick outlines everything else in the show seems to have no outlines whatsoever so it almost looks like a painting and the irises of the characters eyes look incredibly realistic. The general color scheme of the show is very dark consisting of lots or browns, oranges, reds, and grays which reflects the sinister nature of the show. The body proportions of characters in Attack on Titan are some of the most realistic I have seen with only the size of the heads of younger characters being slightly exaggerated and no adherence to the ""all female characters have massive breasts"" cliché that is all to prevalent in anime.

The style and staging of scenes is what separates Attack on Titan from being a good show to an incredible show; the suspense, intensity, and general emotion generated by scenes in this show are fantastic. This can be largely attributed to the shows soundtrack being utilized to its fullest with the timely placed tracks always reflecting the feeling of the conversation being had or actions taking place. Many of the tracks build in intensity in tandem with conversation building in seriousness to the point where it gives you the chills watching. This combined with the powerful driving force of wanting to be free amplifies the intensity of every scene. A specific example of phenomenal staging in Attack on Titan is in one episode Eren and his squad (riding horseback) are being chased by a titan and it seems like they are doomed to be caught. Many people are dying fighting the titan and Eren considers breaking orders and helping the rearguard fight the titan but his squad mate Petra catches him and asks Eren to trust the squad and to continue riding forward. The shot is focused on Petra's face then fades to a very long flash back showing Eren training with the squad culminating in Eren's squad inflicting minor self injury to symbolize their trust in him, the music then picks up while Petra's face is focused on in the flash back and the background fades back to the present with Petra's head remaining in the same position telling Eren to have faith in the squad. Its hard to explain in text but it is the most seamless and appropriate transition from flash back to present I have ever seen and it adds so much significance to the choice Eren has to make.

Attack on Titan has a unique appeal to me that makes it indisputably my favorite show to date. There is something about the simple intensity and hype this show generates every time I watch it that I haven't gotten from any other series. The only barriers that I would see preventing someone from liking this show would be a disliking of gore and traumatic death scenes or the naked bodies or odd facial expressions of the titans scaring people away. Attack on Titan definitely isn't for you if you want something ""light"" to watch either but for anyone who who enjoys dark action/dramas I wholly recommend Attack on Titan and give it a 10 out of 10.",21,12,"May 11, 2014"

Don't worry it will get better. It gets better each season passes. Give it a chance! The only real reason of why this show doesn't have above a 9.0 currently is because of the FMAB fan boys and people whom just hate any show getting higher ratings than their favourites.

Attack on Titan will make viewers question their own morality as they are faced with hard to digest scenarios about these young people going to war based off of the differing realities in their nations.

10,"Attack on Titan! The GOAT they said, very well said","Attack on Titan is the 2nd anime I have watched after Death note and until now I have watched most of the animes,but none of them ever come close to this masterpiece.

This anime has everything you can ask for.

From intresting plot, epic fight scenes, heartbreaking moments, overshadowing , unimaginable twists and much more .

Let me tell you what you are in for if you are starting this anime .

1) FRESH PLOT it's plot is unique and the storytelling is just brilliant. The pacing is really good, you never get bored for even a minute. The way they unfolds the mystery one by one makes you stunned , the detailing they put in ,the foreshadowing they have done is just amazing.

2) BADASS CHARACTERS There are many interesting characters in this anime and their development is really well written. It does not take forever to develop a character like most of the other animes does, Characters like Jean,Erwin ,Reiner are best example of this .

You are gonna love the characters of Eren, Mikasa and Levi (one of the most badass characters).

3) EPIC OSTs Attack on Titan have one of the best OSTs out there. When these epic soundtracks are mixed with the fight scenes then you really feel the goosebumps.

4) INTENSE FIGHT SCENES The fight scenes shown in this anime is just outstanding. You can literally feel the rage,the sadness, of the characters. The dub good too.

The epitome of this review is that ATTACK ON TITAN is the anime that you shouldn't miss .

This is the only anime that surpassed my expectations everytime.

DON'T MISS IT AT ANY COST !!

The storytelling is top-notch and the twists and turns are well executed, leaving the audience on the edge of their seats.

10,The definition of peak fiction,This show is truly amazing. Words can not express the emotions I went through watching it. Eren jeager is arguably the best written character in almost all of fiction. That's just how good he is. His development throughout the show is really interesting. You get to see how his character changes and the events he is out through. Also some of the side characters are insanely likeable and entertaining. Levi and Erwin are easily 10/10 side characters.

Like it's exciting from the very first eposide (many series needs a few eposides to start getting good) and it doesn't stop. Every time you think there's ain't no plot twist could happen anymore, you're so wrong. And damn it, all the plot twist makes so much sense but is still shocking. How amazing is that? The story is so well delivered, amazing animation, fighting scenes and it includes lots of interesting small details that delivers a whole lot meaning. All the characters are well-developed and they are all special and admirable in their own ways. I can't hate anyone. Not only it's an astonishing experience to watch, it also has me questioning about stuff in life or in the society, about war and the meaningless of it. I can't not stop thinking about it. I've been talking about how great AOT is but I never felt enough, I still think that i'm not fully understand all the underlying lessons in it yet. I cannot find any words or sentences that is beautiful enough to describe the superior of AOT.

I feel so lucky so be born so that I can watch AOT. I'll be very happy to be born again to watch it for the first time one more time. That's how much I love it.",7,2,"Nov 8, 2023"
10,The ship of plot twist !,"AOT is the anime that change my thoughts drastically throughout the series. If there are the awards of plot-twisting then this anime will overshadow others, Mark me no words absolutely no words can express this roller coaster ride experience. The overall story is 10/10 there is no lie in it,

this anime is exactly a reflection of human beings currently. We fight for what is ours and we always thought we are rights this is what exactly motivation to fight to the very last. The same goes for others thus we can't define who is right and who is wrong to pick a side as viewers.

This anime is not over-rated it's just simply because the story is amazing. Specifically for me, I watched DBZ, OPM, Naruto, and One Piece. Among all those one piece is my favourite one. And still, this anime somehow made a different spot in my heart.

To beginners, don't aspect the same experience from previous Anime and stories this is a complex journey to understand,

""This is a storm if u manage to survive in it you will have a look at the beautiful sky""",7,2,"Aug 19, 2023"
10,The most INCREDIBLE show i have ever watched.,"It's incredible how they managed to make it so special. This show is one of the greatest i have seen. I have watched almost 30 tv shows including Breaking Bad and Game of Thrones in the last couple of years. They were both an amazing show, had huge impact on viewers and general audiences. At the time, for me, GOT was the best of the best. But when i watched this, i'm kinda gradually giving it to AOT. Because it's perfect, every season and almost every episodes.

Although i got a glimpse of what is to come in the next episode. But i didn't read it completely. Still waiting to read. Anyway, i can't wait for the next one, ""Savagery"" to come out. It's going to be beyond epic. I'm quite sure. I'd have rather rated this more than 10 if it was possible.",7,2,"Jan 19, 2022"
10,My favorite series forevaa,"It's insane how it's been like 3 years since I watched and finished reading and this is still something I think about daily. I love the complexity of the story, the characters, their motives, the way you really see there's no right or wrong side, most people have a motive to fight for what they stand for. Forever my favorite. Haven't even rewatched it because I'm not yet prepared to get the brainrot again.

Something I adore about this anime and manga is the amount of details there are, I only imagine rewatching this and feeling dumb for not noticing most of them. The foreshadowing is amazing.",7,2,"Aug 28, 2023"
10,LEGENDARY MASTERPIECE,"I just finished the final episode and I'm very sad to to see this show go. But the ending was just amazing. Mad respect to the guys who came up with this purely amazing plot and story. This is definitely my favourite show. The twists in this show are great, the story line is great, and the animation itself is perfection. I want more of this but I know if they made it longer it wouldn't be this great. They ended the series at the right time of the story. Eren turns into a very complex character as the story goes on. The show starts out intriguingly, hooking you from the beginning and continues to get better as you move along the story. I feel like I wasted my time watching other shows after I watched the final chapter now. The story is so good I think I will stop watching any show at for a while. This show will be very hard to beat for my #1 favourite. Recommended for everyone. Don't miss out an pure art and watch it!",7,2,"Nov 8, 2023"
10,Better Than GOT,This adaptation is GOT of Anime World. This is my first ever review on this website. Trust me its the best one till now.,7,2,"Jul 20, 2019"
10,One of the best anime ever,"Attack on Titans has to be one of the greatest anime of all the times. The story line is amazing but the animation is next level. The action starts right from 1st episodes and as show goes on it only gets better. Very good plot twist character developments and explanation of the story. It doesn't get boring at all in any season. The actions and animation is one of the best I've ever seen so far, right when you think it can't get any bette they prove you wrong. In beginning you choose a side but later on you realize everyone got a reason to do what they're doing, you can't really hate anyone towards the end.

The whole show at one side and Mikasa is on one side.",7,2,"Sep 29, 2023"

One good thing about Attack on Titan is its unique concept and story. The show portrays a post-apocalyptic world where humanity is fighting for survival against monstrous Titans, and it keeps viewers on the edge of their seats with thrilling action scenes and unexpected plot twists. Additionally, the characters are well-developed and complex, making it easy for viewers to become emotionally invested in their journeys.

I watched all the seasons! K bye!",7,2,"Feb 8, 2022"
10,Couldn't stop crying,"I cried a lot when I saw this fantastic episode. In my opinion, Ymir had suffered a lot in her life. I can not describe in words how I feel about her. Even now that I am writing this text, I am crying for Ymir. How sinless this innocent little girl was...",7,2,"Feb 7, 2022"
10,Watching during war,"I am writing this review being in Russia and witnessing all those things about war and humans in real life. It is almost 2 years since war in Ukraine started and I couldn't make myself to watch anything.

However by some miracle I recalled AOT image of titans, that was so strange and grotesque at some point. I am not into horrors, actually I prefer philosophy and kowledge in a concept. That's why I really believe that titans, those scary titans were not just an image, but sincere and smart attempt from the author to make an impact on viewers.

I really like anime and manga, but every genre has its flaws. And AOT can't avoid some anime genre details. But it doesn't matter because the storytelling and characters are amazing, they are deep, real and represent all human's good and bad traits.

I would like to emphasize that. Isayama definitely used references to many classical works. Greek mythology (image of Eren with big rock on his back as Atlas, idea of eating others as Chronos), ""Gargantua and Pantagruel"" and ""Gulliver's Travels"" as political satire reference, and conscious or not - german voluntaristic philosophy represented in titan will and power, which is emphasized by numerous nuclear and apocalyptic pictures.

I don't want to write long review, just some thoughts of mine. Of course, many viewers are talking about ending. I think partly viewers are disappointed because of the rush in 4th season, compared to balanced tempo of 3rd season. And, of course, many viewers don't understand the depth of grief and sorrow during war.

I am sure that Isayama tried to show us the importance of conscious, of knowledge and self reflection. He isn't trying to avoid the reality of conflict in human's soul. That is why in the ending he is keeping the horror in AOT. But eventually the story AND our reading of the plot is repeating that there are other things that need our constant work, that it is human duty to do our best.

This is truly not only anime masterpiece, but genius of symbolism in a storytelling. I am very thankful to all the authors of this anime, it is beyond anime.",7,2,"Nov 26, 2023"
10,One of the greatest anime in history!,"Followed this anime since 2013, but its finally payed off. From the story line, character, concept etc, this is really a masterpiece. I Really recommend to watch this anime. I can say Mr. Isayama successfully presented this piece of artwork for his fans, even though most of them didn't like the ending, but personally for fans like me who followed this anime since it's first release, long interlude between seasons, uncertain season's premiere schedule, all have been an exhausted journey, but it is really a relief to finally watch the end of this masterpiece. Thank you Mr. Isayama for creating it for us, you are a legend.",7,2,"Nov 6, 2023"
10,THE BEST,"Incredible, I honestly have to say that this could be the best anime ever due to its development and plot. Shingeki No Kyojin has one of the best character developments and plot in history (note that this series does not have fill), he even the secondary and third characters have a great importance in the story, but also has that sense of terror, action and drama that by the way is incredibly well done, makes you live the situation that the characters go through and transmit their emotions to you in a very human way. It has an excellent background story that is simply memorable.

Every decision they make is of minor importance to the series and should not be missed, their deaths and the surprise of knowing who are the real antagonists add a magical touch.",7,2,"May 26, 2022"
10,Awesome,Very very fantastic. It is my best show ever. I put it into my favorite list,7,2,"Aug 14, 2020"
10,One of the greats,"This has to be one of the best anime's ever. The way the characters are developed over the seasons, creating depth that no other show does is masterful. This is further more proven by the action, and how beautifully animated all of it is. This didn't used to be the case but they fixed it later on.

The shows only fault is that it is taking ages to wrap up. Each of the specials are taking half a year each it feels like, and it doesn't help with trying to avoid spoilers since the manga finished last year. This doesn't take away from just how amazing it all is though, and will still remain one of my top rated anime's if it finishes well.",7,2,"Jul 5, 2023"

10,"Not only one of the best animes, but one of the best shows ever.","A masterpiece, which not only has a well formed plot and complete characters, but it also shows the true nature of humanity and its endless repercussions to social and ethical stability. None is evil, none is good. We re all prisoners of our own nature even though we continuously try to stay and be free . What else need I to say. You have to see it in order to understand. Each season could be its own series with a different problematic and character development. You can not have only one favourite character for some reason because every each of them has a role on the play and a different dynamic.

Homo homini lupus.",7,2,"Sep 22, 2023"
10,Best Anime oat,"Really a masterpiece of Hajime Isayama. If you watched the anime then you know that it's just mindblowing especially after the 3rd or 4rd season because i think they are just peak the 1st and 2nd season were also good but not as good as the 3rd and 4rd. Ich gave this anime an 10/10 because Hajime Isayama did a absolutely amazing job with this show. He thought about everything.

I can also say that eren is my absolutely favorit one just because you can see how he is growing and changing after all the seasons and armin and mikasa are also cool and i think that the whole squad with levi, erwin, Hanji, Connie, Sasha, Jean and Historia are just great. But i don't like the ending that much.

Overall i think it's just the best anime and show of all time.",7,2,"Aug 20, 2023"
10,SPECTACULAR,Never before I've seen a series with this intensity. Each and every episode has its own importance and the pace with which the plot progresses is just amazing . Definitely one of the if not the best series I've ever seen. A must watch for everyone.,7,2,"Feb 25, 2022"

On my opinion season 1 had no mistakes it was perfect everything in it was soo perfect. Season 3 part 1 was soooo good and also part 2 was even better. Season 2 wasn't that special but it was not bad also. But it doesn't mean that I liked every single bit of this anime. There are also things that I hate about this anime like 1) the animation. In my opinion the animation was not that good but it was not the worst also. 2) they talk alot. But these things didn't make me hate this anime and I hope you watch it. It is a very very good anime.",7,2,"Aug 17, 2023"

10,The end of Aot,"Can't believe that this anime finally came to an end. Attack on Titan: A Triumph of Storytelling and Animation

Attack on Titan is nothing short of a modern masterpiece in the world of anime and manga. This dark fantasy series, created by Hajime Isayama, has captivated audiences worldwide with its compelling characters, intricate plot, and breathtaking animation. With a story that explores complex themes, a richly developed world, and outstanding character development, Attack on Titan stands as a testament to the power of storytelling in the medium of anime.

One of the most striking aspects of Attack on Titan is its world-building. The series is set in a dystopian future where humanity is on the brink of extinction, besieged by colossal humanoid creatures known as Titans. The remnants of humanity reside within massive walled cities, and their fear of the Titans drives the narrative. The world within the walls is meticulously crafted, with a detailed history, hierarchy, and culture that feels both realistic and immersive. This world-building not only serves as a backdrop but also plays a significant role in the plot's progression.

The story itself is a rollercoaster of emotions, with unexpected twists and turns that keep viewers on the edge of their seats. It begins with the destruction of the outermost wall, which leads to chaos and tragedy. The protagonist, Eren Yeager, witnesses the death of his mother and the loss of his home, setting the tone for the series. Eren's determination to exterminate the Titans and uncover the truth behind their existence becomes the driving force behind the story. As the narrative unfolds, viewers are taken on a journey of political intrigue, moral dilemmas, and personal growth.

Character development is another area where ""Attack on Titan"" excels. The series boasts a diverse and multi-dimensional cast of characters, each with their own strengths, weaknesses, and motivations. Eren, Mikasa, Armin, Levi, and a host of other characters undergo significant growth throughout the series. Their evolution is both realistic and thought-provoking, as they grapple with the harsh realities of their world. Eren, in particular, goes through a transformation from a brash and impulsive young man to a more complex and introspective character.

One of the series' notable strengths is its ability to tackle profound themes. Attack on Titan delves into subjects like freedom, oppression, the consequences of violence, and the inherent fear of the unknown. It encourages viewers to question the morality of the characters' actions and the world they inhabit. The moral ambiguity present in the story adds layers of depth and complexity to the narrative, making it more than just a straightforward battle between humans and Titans.

The animation in Attack on Titan is nothing short of breathtaking. The action sequences are fluid and intense, with stunningly choreographed battles between the human soldiers and the Titans. The attention to detail in the character designs and the towering Titans themselves is impressive. The animation studio, Wit Studio, and later MAPPA, have done a commendable job in bringing Isayama's world to life. The sound design and music also deserve praise, with an epic and haunting score that enhances the emotional impact of the story.

One of the series' crowning achievements is its ability to keep viewers invested over its four seasons. The pacing is well-managed, and the story continues to evolve, introducing new characters, mysteries, and conflicts. The gradual revelation of the truth behind the Titans and the world's history adds layers of intrigue and keeps audiences engaged. ""Attack on Titan"" is a testament to the importance of a well-crafted narrative, where every piece of the puzzle eventually falls into place.

The emotional impact of Attack on Titan cannot be understated. The series doesn't shy away from exploring the depths of despair and the heights of hope. Viewers become deeply attached to the characters and their struggles, which makes the losses and victories all the more poignant. It's a series that can elicit a wide range of emotions, from heart-wrenching sadness to triumphant joy.

In conclusion, Attack on Titan is a modern anime masterpiece that has left an indelible mark on the medium. Its intricate world-building, compelling characters, and thought-provoking themes make it a standout series that appeals to both anime enthusiasts and newcomers alike. With its stunning animation and gripping storytelling, it has set a high standard for what anime can achieve. If you haven't experienced the world of ""Attack on Titan"" yet, you're in for a captivating and emotional journey that is well worth the watch.",7,2,"Nov 5, 2023"

A totally new type of stories started with a lot of questions, those questions ends us with an answer by the season finale which the answers gets us even more questions to answer.

There's an answer for every singe question in your mind about the show so you will never be confused about some questions that are not filled with answers.

The depth of the story gives us an experience for a perfect story, where the story began 2000 years before the main story begins and it's related to the episodes that you'll see.

The development of the characters is matched perfectly with the depth and the events of the story.

The details and foreshadowing for the upcoming events and episodes are insane (sometimes it foreshadows about somethings in the past).

The series has a great ending but you have to accept it.

In my opinion there is no better ending than the one we got.",3,0,"Oct 13, 2024"

The moment you watch this audiovisual masterpiece you will immediately appreciate the level of thought and detail that went into this.

From episode to episode you'll think that you won't be surprised anymore and you'll be wrong again and again, every time I thought an episode or season couldn't be better I was proven wrong. You will get goos bumps from dialog alone and you will lose your mind in the epic fight scenes The characters and their development, the story covered in mystery that unveils beautifully, a dialog carefully written that shows the characters personalities and wisdom., sound design, music, illumination... you'll feel like you are there.

10,Titan-ically Good: A Review of Attack on Titan,"Okay, so Attack on Titan... where do I even begin? This show absolutely blew me away. From the very first episode, I was hooked. The animation is stunning, the story is gripping, and the characters are incredibly complex and well-developed.

I mean, the world-building is just insane. The idea of these giant man-eating titans terrorizing humanity is terrifying, and the way the show explores themes of survival, loss, and the complexities of war is truly thought-provoking.

Mikasa is my absolute favorite. I just fell in love with her. She's an absolute badass. I love how strong and independent she is, and she's such a loyal and fierce friend.

Eren is another character I really connected with. He's definitely got some flaws, but he's incredibly driven and passionate, and you can't help but root for him.

The show keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire time. There are so many twists and turns, and you never know what's going to happen next. I found myself constantly theorizing and trying to predict the plot, but the show always managed to surprise me.

Honestly, I can't recommend this show enough. It's definitely not for the faint of heart, but if you're looking for a thrilling and thought-provoking anime experience, Attack on Titan is a must-watch.

My Rating: 9.5/10.",3,0,"Jan 29, 2025"
10,The colorful world of Attack on Titan,"Attack on Titan by Hajime Isayama introduces you to a world enclosed by massive walls to protect humanity from giant man-eating humanoids called Titans. The walls are a double-edged sword while they serve as the last bastion of humanity's survival, they also act as a giant cage, trapping its people and preventing them from seeing the real world outside.

It is an emotional rollercoaster that forces you to evoke strong feelings and emotions throughout the ride as you navigate the twists and turns of the plot to find the truth. I personally recommend Attack on Titan as it is a controversial series that exists in a whole new narrative outside the general good and evil trope. It explores the grey areas and complexities of human nature, morality, the will to survive, and the fragility that leads to conflict.

Furthermore, it tackles real-world issues such as racism, discrimination, and the destructive effects of hatred. At its core is its sense of realism in portraying the never-ending cycle of human destruction and regeneration and what it takes to achieve freedom. It allows viewers to see different perspectives and apply philosophical thoughts to interpret the overall message the story is trying to convey.

In the end, Attack on Titan is a worthwhile watch that never fails to amaze us. It is absolute cinema!

Thank you, Hajime Isayama, for creating this masterpiece!",3,0,"Feb 20, 2025"

9,AMAZING ANIME !,"AOT gave us 10 STRONG years of good animation, AMAZING fight scenes, shock value, plot twists, amazing characters, and phenomenal voice acting. I watched this in Sub which is highly recommended for the real feel but the English Dub isn't bad at all.

This anime has one of the strongest opening episodes to me because they wasted no time giving us the action. But at the same time this show is very well paced because gradually throughout the show we learn things about the Titans and the history of the people. Not only that but we're learning at the same time as the characters so a discovery for them is also a discovery for audiences as well. I think it was a good touch to not give us the audience the drop on EVERYTHING before the MC because it kept us wanting more.

The Titans were absolutely visually pleasing, I personally enjoyed that over the course of the series we start to see the different variations of Titans and the things they can do. The fight scene animation was consistently clean especially when it came to the Titans fight.

The political touch of AOT was a great way to spin this because it gave us a understanding of just how deep the plot really goes and gave them room to make it deeper. They took time to explain, and paid attention to details so the plot holes aren't that big, even though I am left with a few questions.

But overall, this is a great anime. Ive watched it over and over. I recommend it to almost everyone if they never seen it before. There is alot of action, blood, adventure, sadness, chaos, and the power of friendship.",3,0,"Nov 24, 2024"

9,A Great Story that should be experienced by everyone at-least once in their lifetime,"'Attack on Titan' is an anime series based on 'Hajime Isayama's' manga series of the same name.The series takes place in a dystopian world where humans have been pushed to the brink of extinction by large man eating giants known as titans and follows 'Eren Jaeger' a young military soldier and orphan who wants to avenge his mother's death by killing all the titans.From the get go attack on titan establishes itself as a high octane action horror story with tons of violence and graphic content but there is much more to it than meets the eye.This show that started with a simple monster hunting premise soon evolves into a story involving politics,religion and racism,paired with some great character growth and constantly developing character relationships turns into one of the best dark fantasies to be ever written.The writing is not the only good thing about this show as this show also excels in the technical department with fantastic animation from 'Studio Wit',a gorgeous soundtrack and amazing sound design. I would recommend 'Attack on Titan' to anybody who is even remotely interested in a dark fantasy story line despite of the fact of weather you like anime or not.I can assure you that if you give it a chance 'Attack on Titan will not disappoint.",3,0,"Jun 16, 2020"

10,Goated!!!,"I for a certainty believe that this is the best anime series to date. I got spoiled the ending of the story, aswell as some character deaths, and I still think this show is a perfect 10/10. If I hadn't been spoiled, perhaps this would not just have been my favourite anime ever, but my favourite series overall. Actually it probably is, it's just that good!",3,0,"Mar 6, 2021"
10,Great anime with interesting story,"I'm not an expert in anime and I've never read the manga, however, I can tell you the anime is simply amazing. From the talented casts, the top-quality animation, and to the compelling storytelling. Not many anime can surpass Attack on Titan in terms of viewer and fanbase and there are reasons why it became such a well-known anime. From the initial moment you watch the first episode, you are constantly left on the edge of your seat and when each episode ends it leaves you wanting for more. As you move further on to the next episode, the story doesn't get stale and, surprisingly, it gets more and more interesting and as it gets deeper into the story, it makes you wonder endlessly about the story behind the Titan and the characters. The anime is praised for its amazing plot. On the outside, it may seem like a simple story: human vs monster. Who will win? However, as the story slowly unwrap it true form, it makes you realize that it's not as simple as you think and many of the events in the anime are somehow connected and important later on in the storyline. It makes you want to surrender all your attention to the story and use your imagination to come up with theories to fill your curiosity. Apart from the amazing story, the animation is top quality and the sound is just outstanding. Compared to other action anime, there is none that feel as smooth and realistic as Attack on Titan. The character feels real and the environment is unique and believable. The only downside I can think of this anime is how there are inconsistency in the story every once in a while, but, still, the story is too good to miss out on.",3,0,"Mar 5, 2021"

10,"Amazing Story, Awesome Action, A Must Watch","A very unique and emotionally gripping story. Probably the best new anime of 2013. I enjoyed it so much I had a Netflix marathon and watched every episode of Season 1 over the course of a few days.

Pity we have some hecklers who are butthurt and say the character development is missing and clichéd and that the story goes nowhere. I disagree; I love the characters and I love the story; one of the most unique stories I have ever seen, in fact. It's only season 1, so stop expecting to know all the answers. Season 1 is meant to keep up suspense and interest in the show, and as far as I'm concerned, I want to know more. I want to know more about the Titans. I want to know more about the characters.

10/10. Can't wait for Season 2.",12,6,"Dec 23, 2014"

10,Shingeki no kyojin,"Aot is outstanding anime of all time. It set record on tv history by its rating and so much hype for it, beside that Aot follows the great storyline and this make it a masterpiece series. In early time while iam watching Aot it seems some kind regular monsters or zombies show where people are scared of it always try to save their life.but after watching its some of episode it will make a big of Aot, it is not as other anime i watched. I can't explain my clear feeling on Aot . It has also teach us that we made our own enemy by ownself and chain of hatred shall continu for the centuries. I love eren yaeger and levi Ackerman and others main character. These two shares the same darkest past in anime but both have their own mindset of dealing with chaos.",5,1,"Jan 21, 2022"
10,BEST STORYTELLING,"I didn't think Aot was good at first, but when I look back I realize that so much thought and care is put into the story, and everything just clicks and adds up. This is Easily one of the best pieces of storytelling in history. If I had to choose one show to watch for the rest of my life, I would choose Attack on Titan. I freaking LOVE this show.",5,1,"Apr 1, 2021"
10,Brilliant long epic,"Absolutely amazing and awesome.

The first 2-3 episodes, I couldn't quite get the point, but then each episode further, it became more and more gripping and intriguing. A storyline where more and more context gets added, while more mysteries appear, step by step, while the overall picture gets broader and clearer and evermore brilliant.

I do not want to include any spoilers but have to still write more text for the review.

Personally, this series gave me very much really valuable inspiration for developing all potentials of the human powers that may be in any ways whatsoever.

A true masterpiece of storytelling, I do feel awestruck over how ingenious it is made.

Very very much appreciated!

Deeply thankful for it.",5,1,"Jan 25, 2025"

10,"Amazing and unique story, but not for younger than teens.","This show caught my eye after seeing a trailer for it. The artwork looked amazing and it looked like the kind of dramatic and action packed show I wanted to check out. After starting, I must say I'm amazed. There is never a boring moment in the series and the show has this kind of feel like no one is safe, not even the main protagonists. I'm not going to spoil anything here but the show isn't for the weak of heart. Below is just a content review in case you are planning to watch the show.

Violence: 8/10 Not every episode has action, but when there is, it can get bloody and intense. Sex/Nudity: 1/10 The Titans wear no clothes, but don't have any genitalia. Language: 7/10 Depending on what version you watch the cursing varies. The dub isn't anything more than PG-13 level though. Frightening/Intense Scenes: 8/10 Nearly every episode has an intense and unsettling fell to it. Major characters can be killed at any time and it will happen. The Titans can appear quite menacing at times. The show isn't exactly dark, but it does set a grim and intense mood.

Suggested for 14 and up.",5,1,"May 23, 2016"
10,Truly a Modern Epic !,"I had doubts watching this show 9 years ago , i felt it was too desperately brutal , why everything is just soo bad in their world ? Then season 2 came with its sad news of canceling the show, i even stopped watching it at some point because i felt they were killing time with half of the season episodes , but then season 3 came , now it all makes sense now you can relate to all the characters feel their pain , understand their motive and this is the most brilliant thing about a show ! Whenever u feel complicated between what is right or wrong ,whenever your heart tells you something but your mind says otherwise , creating this feeling in the viewers is one of the true purpose of art.

This anime is actually what it claims to be , A modern epic.

Times after times after times it gave us jaw dropping episodes one after another , usually one of these kind of episodes is enough for an entire show .

I always felt sad to see japan cinema fall soo low after 90's but now I'm super proud they followed it amazingly in anime industry .",5,1,"Jan 25, 2022"
10,One of the best manga to start watching right now,"Since the first trailers in 2013, I knew this was gonna be interesting. But I waited 2021 to watch the show. And I wasn't able to not binge it in one week or so. That means almost 60 episodes (of 20' length).

I'm glad I didn't have to wait for season 2 (which took 3 to 4 years to come out). It is a rollercoaster of emotions, palpitations and bliss. I loved every minute of it.

I cannot say I gathered all the arcs correctly but I think I will watch it again from the start because it was too powerful. The end of season 3 and the beginning of season 4 are a culmination in storytelling. I have been blown away and completely immersed in the story and the characters, and also I admit, Ifell in love with Mikasa.",5,1,"May 30, 2021"

I never saw the anime again for years until i found out its name, I loved the show as i watched past episode one and finished all three seasons, then i waited for season four, and it was even better than the last three put together, it is the best show ever, great world building, great storytelling, elite foreshadowing, overall genuinely the best piece of not just animanga, but cinema ive ever seen.",5,1,"Sep 26, 2024"

10,The perfect anime,"This is hands down the best anime I have seen yet. It's got super interesting characters, and in the later seasons there is an insane ammount of character development as well. The world is incredibly creative, mysterious, unpredictable and realistic within its bounds. If this world existed in real life things would probably happen quite similar to the way they do in the show. The animation is incredible and the action sequences are mind-blowing. The horror scenes which is mostly take place in the first season are terrific and the characters reactions to the horrific events are portrayed in an incredibly realistic way. The show does get very emotional and dramatic , which you wouldn't expect in a gory horror-fantasy show but the horrific world of the show makes room for scenes that get so emotional you almost cannot take it. Oh and I almost forgot it's got an amazing score and openings as well. I would recommend this anime to anyone even if anime is usually not your thing since it's so well made and moves awa from standard anime clichés.",5,1,"Sep 20, 2019"

10,Masterpiece of anime's,"I watched this show in 2013, and in the first episode I knew it was suppose to be different of everything I was used to watch. The animation, the voices, the music, all of these kept me on the edge of the couch.

The main idea of this show is demonstrate what REALLY would happen in a ""monsters"" invasion. In a common invasion show, there is always a hero who kills everything, save everybody and survive for the best of humanity. But not here. The author doesn't have a favorite character, everyone has equal chances of dying and many times they really die.

If you are used to watch kids anime's, this one will scare you. But it also will change the way you face survivors shows. They know how to connect it with real life; if you are a warrior and you make a mistake, no one will save you, because in real life probably you wouldn't be saved.

I truly recommend it, but it's one way ticket, you will probably lose hype for others popular anime's.",5,1,"Nov 26, 2017"

This should be ur 1st go ...This anime has a seperate fan base ..and as a die hard AoT fan i will forever be in my heart.,5,1,"Jan 26, 2022"
10,Best anime I've ever seen,"Attack on Titan is nothing short of a masterpiece.

The show begins by introducing you to the characters in a seemingly safe and confined space, only to shatter that sense of security the moment the first Titan appears. From this point on, you experience the fear and drive of the characters as they desperately seek to uncover the mysteries surrounding the Titans and the world they inhabit. What starts as a small-scale story quickly expands, evolving from a simple family tale to an epic that spans the entire universe the show is set in.

The pacing is near perfect, balancing intense action with moments of quiet reflection. The plot is masterfully constructed, filled with twists and turns that keep you fully engaged. I found myself completely immersed in the narrative, often unable to stop watching after an episode ended.

My biggest concern was the ending, as the sheer scale of the story made it hard to imagine how everything could be wrapped up in a way that felt satisfying. However, my fears were unfounded. The show skillfully tied together all the plotlines, delivering a conclusion in the final season that felt both coherent and fulfilling.",5,1,"Sep 29, 2024"

The combination of action, drama, and beautiful storytelling all ties together so well with the world created around the titans and every new episode I watched became my new favorite. Not only is the story telling amazing but the littles details that tie it all together. The music and scoring for example fits every moment perfectly and enhances the scene. Every bit of this show is incredibly emotion inducing and I can't even find other words except: Best. Show. Ever.",5,1,"Dec 31, 2023"

10,Best anime out there,"This is the best anime ever. The story line, the animation, the awesome battle scenes, all of it. It must be watched in sub. The voices and everything else just aren't right and you can't experience the masterpiece if you're watching the dubbed version.",5,1,"Sep 26, 2020"
10,The peak of animation,"Attack on Titan or Shingeki no Kyojin actually hit the peak of anime right now. There hasn't been any anime like this before and after this end there won't be one as good as this one for a long time. Everything is written so well, the level of detail, the animation, the original soundtracks, almost every character is so memorable.

Unsurprisingly this anime has multiple episodes rated at a 10 with over 50 thousand votes on them. This is truly a masterpiece and you won't regret watching it, which each season bringing new characters, uncovering secrets and just legendary moments, the anime shifts with each season keeping it original and fresh. You might get turned off at first when witnessing the titans for the first time, but trust me when I say this, you will not regret watching this.

With the series almost ending I felt I had to put a review in the hopes that more people will witness this masterpiece, I don't use the word masterpiece lightly, but this truly is a masterpiece. I can actually compare the writing to the first few seasons of Game of Thrones that's how good this anime is.",5,1,"Mar 27, 2021"

10,This will break you.,"This anime is literally perfect. The music is amazing, and the plot was written so well. I read the manga (comic for the series) and once you come back to it it reveals so much more. Isayama is a time-traveler, and the way he implemented everything can be compared to a chess player, he knew how to do everything. This will leave you crying and broken. Not a single anime I have watched (I have watched many from black clover to full metal alchemist) could do that. I have seen people give bad reviews for the art and animation, but is that really an issue? I mean, it changes nothing at all. For crying out loud, even a child could animate this plot and it would be amazing.",5,1,"Feb 26, 2021"
10,the cruel world that presented to us from the beginning drugged me from the start,"The characters development jeez the beauty the action scenes its all there.

Best script ever by the way.

Eren is an amazing character with a great background story. And feels like a human being. Real personality that we all can agree on. The running after revenge.

Even though season 3 and 4 contains more background storys from different characters we obviously stick with the og group since we connected with them but there all still charming.

The titans are one of my favourite parts in the show.

Even i was scary when they drove into shiganshina!

Animation is really good. Not going to get into the mappa vs wit debate, but both studios did a really good job bringing the manga to life.

As a manga reader, the characters motivations make so much sense. Nothing happens without a reason.

I see a lot of one star reviews from people who know nothing about the show but don't want an anime to defeat breaking bad. Y'all are so stupid and immature. Let art be art. There's literally no need to fight.",5,1,"Jan 27, 2022"
10,Absolute MASTERPIECE. Like Nothing I've ever seen.,"Where to begin... This show absolutely blew me away, leaving me in awe of how a work of fiction could have such a profound impact on me.

I'm relatively new to watching anime but not to film and TV. I have seen shows and movies that have left me happy, sad, stunned, shocked, and exhilarated, but nothing has given me the feeling I got from watching Attack on Titan. I'm writing this after finishing the finale, and I'm still trembling from what I witnessed.

The story is beautifully crafted with numerous well-thought-out details and twists and turns. You can tell that Hajime Isayama poured his heart into creating this masterpiece, and it truly shines. I fell in love with the world, which is dark and twisted, and the characters, who are all flawed.

The animation is stunning, showcasing the hard work of the animators. The music, exquisitely composed, made each scene unforgettable. And the voice acting... The Japanese voice actors are incredible and gave me goosebumps. You can feel every emotion from them, whether it's joy, fear, excitement, or dread.

I am truly a changed man. I don't know if anything else will bring me the exhilaration that AOT did. Attack on Titan isn't just an anime; it's a masterful work of fiction that deserves a place in history books.

If you haven't watched the show, go watch it, and I guarantee you won't regret it.",5,1,"Sep 2, 2024"

10,The greatest anime of all time,"This anime is absolutely outstanding. There is no filler at all, like in most other anime, the character dynamics and the character development is fantastic, the pacing is very good and the story is just plainly the best story in all of anime. The way these quite one dimensional characters mature and get more and more complex with the story, and the way the story keeps evolving and keeps changing the context of the story as a whole is just great.

The sounddesign and the soundtrack are godtier, the animation is incredible, and the japanese dub is incredeble. The german and english dub are also quite fantastic.

You see, I cant stop about how awesome this show is, in my opinion, this show does everything right and is almost flawless. If youve never watched a single anime this is a great introduction, because almost all of animes major weaknesses are absent.

Watch this show goddammit.",5,1,"Jan 17, 2022"

10,SIMPLY EPIC,"I am 38 years old and watched this with my teen kids as it's pretty hard to find common interests, and I just wanted us to spend some time together. This is unbelievably good; I enjoyed every moment of it. It's not only great action but also amazing philosophy that you can feed your brain with. It shook me deeply and made me rethink so many things in my life. It's been a while since I finished watching it, but I still keep coming back to it and rewatching the moments that were the most influential for me, like Kenny and Levi's last conversation, for instance. To summarise, this is a must-watch masterpiece.",5,1,"Sep 2, 2024"

10,Perfect in everything ---- more perfect than last ---- more and more and more ... ---,"When I saw the first episodes of Attack on Titan, I realized that it is a special anime . I had not seen many anime at that time but this one was a new indicator for me. It's all perfect, music, story, characters and .... everything .The fourth season of this series went against all my expectations. However, it was better than I expected. Everyone should watch this masterpiece .Each episode of the series progresses from the previous episode and there is no repetitive weakness anywhere.",5,1,"Mar 24, 2021"
10,yes,"Epic art and story, best at every aspect you can think of, one of the legendary animes no doubt... id love if the manga ending changed though, but still, AoT claps...",5,1,"Jan 27, 2022"
10,A Classic In The Making,"There are so much to say about Attack On Titan. I can go all day about every single episode. This shows renews itself with every episode, I have never left disappointed, not for once. It kept improving and improving, with each season getting better (which is a very rare trait in tv).

Isayama is a mad genius with his writing; how he saw everything from the start, how we saw the story slowsly lead upt o where it is and how every single event is put in perfectly. One of the best and most underrated thing about it is that there is no filler characters. Everyone has their own story, everyone holds a huge place in everything. Even a small side character will turn out to be the biggest plot point in the story. Everyone is so well written and real. The action, animation, soundtrack, storyline... The only reason Attack On Titan isn't as recognized as other tv classics is simply just prejudice against anime or being under the affect of 'iT's PopUlaR AnD oVerRatEd' side. Attack On Titan is one of a kind and will go down in history with its glorious finish. Season 4 already hosts what could possibly be the single most well written episodes of the show- and with such high criteria after the masterpiece of season 3 part 2. Everything you questioned, everything you coukdn'r even question is shown there. Rewatching the show after finishing it, you can clearly see something slight that happened later foreshadowed in season 1. Brilliant.

With Isayama and the producers, I have no doubts that this will be one of the biggest shows of all time.",5,1,"Feb 7, 2021"

10,Simply the greatest thing ever made.,"This is a masterpiece every episode is amazing and the overall story and charecters are the greatest ever. I don't care if you think I'm biased: I don't think hero is the best episode of all time because I love attack on titan, I don't think Eren is the best protagonist oat because I love attack on titan, I don't think the the script is the best written story because I love attack on titan. I love attack on titan for those reasons. And so many more.",5,1,"Dec 22, 2020"

10,"You watch the first part, then see, can you not see anymore?","They asked a scientist. Are we alone in this world? That is, there are no other beings with whom we can communicate?

The scientist answers. Consider a worm. Does this worm have no understanding of our human world. We can crush this cream whenever we want and kill it. The reason is this: is it worth it?

So now let's relate this to our world and other beings in the universe. Because we do not understand them, am we worthless to them? A backward civilization. But the main question is, are they interested in crushing us? When will the time come?

This anime created exactly the same situation for me. Maybe we are inside the walls that we named the world, the planet and .. We imprisoned ourselves.

Maybe our memories have been erased and that is why we are not able to go beyond these walls, maybe even our fellow human beings did go and not tell us the essence of the matter ?! This maybe ... .

Attack on Titan animation raises crazy questions in the human mind. Each episode shocks the viewer. There is no rush to tell the story and the surprises are very well arranged.

10,Perfection,"I don't even know where to start I can't even fit my entire opinion in this review. The characters are perfect the story is perfect i just can't describe in any way or form how good this is, I've watched about 60 different amines which isn't a flex but out of everything I've watched so far, they don't even come near to how good attack on titan is. I'm kind of disappointed in a part of the Aot community though since there's people complaining and crying that Eren changed in the last season and other characters are getting more screentime. The anime has one of the best ratings ever. 100% recommended.",8,3,"Feb 15, 2023"

10,A show showing the true realty of human being in dramatic way,"Aot is by far great show until now. It's character motives, world building is really detailed. Animation also too good considering there's lots of action in the show. I don't want to say anything about the OST cause it's beyond my worth. Some people finds it flawed by saying characters are not shown correctly or world building is not great. I don't know which part is wrong cause I have never this much detailed story in a fantasy show.",8,3,"Jan 28, 2022"
10,"See you later, AOT.","Look, if you have never seen attack on titan this is for you. GO WATCH RIGHT NOW. I am serious. Do not even hesitate. Do not even walk, RUN. You will never regret watching this masterpiece. You will laugh, cry, be horrified, be happy, overwhelmed, hyped, completely devastated and completely relieved, all in one anime. There are no words to describe the roller coaster ride this anime will take you on. Apart from the absolutely brilliant animation. The storyline and narration and dialogues are something out of this world. Plot twists after plot twists and trust me once you get to the finale, you will never recover, in the best possible way.

See you on the other side.",8,3,"Nov 8, 2023"
10,The most passionate anime I've ever seen.,"On the basis of anti-war to do this anime so well, so warm, I really see it for the first time. This anime is really worth everyone to watch repeatedly, not only the surface of the blood fighting, The most common word among them is tatakai. Yes, every one of us should fight for ourselves. We should not be a bird in a cage and be imprisoned in this heaven and earth.",8,3,"Aug 3, 2022"

10,I have to be honest here. This is a MASTERPIECE,"The characters, pacing, foreshadowing, action, story, world building, drama, and even diologe. Everything is perfect EVERYTHING. Not one falter. Never did it feel slow, boring, never was I not interested. When the changed the animation studio (WIT-MAPPA) I was skeptical to say the least but I am loving it. MAPPA already was my favorite studio and still is. I've waited a year for this ending, it's not ended yet but I will update then. Don't listen to the one starrers, there just jealous that's it's much better then there favorite show. Also if you don't like it because it's anime get over it. This isn't just an anime.

10,The Best Show You Will Ever Watch,"Spoiler free First of all don't think that this a anime so it won't be realistic This show is more real than your reality shows Now let's come to the review Starting with Story Oh man , it's literally impossible to express incredibility of the story in words , The story manages make you scream in almost every episode, Not a single episode will bore , you will find better story in every episode Direction I say this one of the best direction works of all time what make its the best show is its direction , the writer , director are absolute geniuses Music The music is going to make you jump on sofa , The soundtrack is absolutely fantastic. Even after completing the show you would be listening to its openings and ending music for ever

Plot twist Let's just not talk about that cause I don't want to spoil But I can say that each one of them will make you scream

Animation Talking about animation it has pretty good animation for both titans and humans and all fights they do , both wit and mappa studio have done a great job

Characters All characters are good and well written S1 is basically around mc but later every character gets to shine you may find the mc boring in first 3 season but then you will watch S4 ..............and then you will want to marry the MC lol ,jokes apart MC character is one of the best protagonist of all time but you will have to wait.

Foreshadowing I think aot has the best foreshadowing in television history, Isayama is literally a god of story writing and foreshadowing, sometimes it feels like isayama started writing the story from the end , so ya in this story a bird flying has more significance then the existence of you and me ... Lmao!

And last want to say many believe that bb is best show of all time But aot has better Plot twist Plot Story Action Foreshadowing Visuals Concept World building Suspense Tension

So if you into those aot is the best show of all time.",8,3,"Feb 23, 2023"

10,Stunning Story Telling,"I watched this while high quite often. It is an absolutely amazing storytelling. I was constantly adapting my views to the inspiration and purpose behind the shows creator. It is so well written it's the work of a genius storyteller, so clearly there must be something behind it.

First it was easy. The Titans are corporate Greed. The Abnormals the billionaires etc. Then it just had to consistently branch out, just like on our world. We are told lies to hate. We are victims of a system that in the end, is just all about Greed.

Naturally we have the many factions of the system, workers, those that enforce the laws on behalf of the wealthy, the businessmen that exploit the system, because they not stupid enough to fall victim for it, so they give away their integrity and loyalty and they become their own worst self. Then there is the religious and royalties.",8,3,"Dec 15, 2022"
10,Greatest Animation Series,Phenomenal story with a unique premise and amazing character development.

10,Sensational jewel!!,"I was completely blown away with this masterwork. Due to the fact that I'm an ardent anime fan, these series have impacted my mind significantly. No sooner did I begin to watch the episodes, I dove into a miraculous world full of war and abhorrence and betrayal and reconciliations. Though it was a bit too complicated at the end of the final season to fathom strategy and incentives of each character what they were fighting for, the way the characters were portrayed was divine!

I would totally recommend it to everyone who doesn't understand the concept of anime itself and would like to be fully plunged into the atmosphere of hyper intense battles and unexpected confessions! It will guarantee the viewer to deliver all the spectrum of enthralling and inconceivable emotions!",8,3,"Dec 1, 2022"

10,GREATEST STORY EVER TOLD. What a time to be alive!,"Characters, music, plot... I wouldn't know where to start. I used to watch anime and series during all my life, but I stopped firmly because everything was just overhyped for no reason and ended up in the worst possible way most of the time.

But this, this is the product of a super human. I can't believe all the goosebumps I get watching every single episode. Every detail, even the smallest one, is in its place, accurate, well prepared. I cannot even think the hard work that has to be behind this masterpiece.

Nonetheless, what surprised me the most was the whole story, it's insane, it's unimaginable to be honest, an endless twist (A COUP DE THEATRE!!!).

I pray and hope that as many people as possible could watch it and enjoy.

Attack on titan overcomes the concept of series or anime, and stands right in an higher level, alongside with Breaking Bad (The only show which comes to my mind that gets close). Out of any ranking. Out of any critic. What a time to be alive...

May this piece of art become the most rated serie of all time, with a 10 out of 10. And may the next generations watch it and remember it forever.",9,4,"Nov 14, 2023"

This is an anime that you definitely have to watch.",9,4,"Feb 6, 2023"
10,Aot is the best thing ever written,"""Attack on Titan"" stands as an unparalleled masterpiece in the realm of anime. With its rich and multifaceted narrative, it leaves an indelible mark on the viewer's psyche. The series is a tour de force in storytelling, consistently pushing the boundaries of what can be achieved in the medium. Its complex characters, each laden with their own inner demons and motivations, draw the audience into a web of intrigue and sympathy.

The thematic depth is staggering, exploring concepts of freedom, morality, and the consequences of human actions in a post-apocalyptic world. It doesn't shy away from the darkness of human nature, prompting viewers to contemplate profound questions about the human condition.

What truly sets ""Attack on Titan"" apart is its animation quality. The visuals are a testament to the art form, showcasing meticulous detail and fluidity in every frame. The action sequences are unparalleled, immersing you in epic battles and heart-pounding encounters.

Character development is extraordinary; you'll find yourself emotionally invested in their journeys. As they grapple with moral dilemmas and confront their own vulnerabilities, you'll experience a deep connection with them.

""Attack on Titan"" has redefined what anime can be, captivating a global audience with its complexity and emotional resonance.

10,A masterpiece,"Attack on titan was the first ever anime series I watched. Got to say it's not a good idea to start a journey with a masterpiece. It raises your standards to the extent you can't enjoy other works easily. It has such a gripping story that glues you to the screen. Every episode, every scene and every dialogue is worth watching twice or more. It's not a mere fantasy story. Once you give it more thought, a deeper philosophy is revealed to you.

And one more thing. Don't judge it based on the first few episodes (I was already invested in the story by the second episode tho). At least give a chance to the first season.",10,5,"Jan 27, 2023"
10,The greatest show of all time,"I don't think I'm over exaggerating by saying that this is the greatest show in television, and this is why:

1. Attack on titan has the best music I've heard in any movie, game or TV-show. This show knows when to use a soundtrack at the right moment.

2. Attack on titan has the best episodes of all time. Besides from the rating, it couldn't be more obvious that almost every episode ends like it's a season-finale. I don't know if Isayama does it purposefully to attract more viewers, or if the writing is just that good, but the return to shiganshina-, memories of the future- and the attack on marley arc are some of the best arcs in any tv-shows I've seen. Every one of these has 2-3 9.9 episodes in them.

3. The plot twists in this show is somethng I've never seen in any other show. Of course there are some major plot twists in series like mr robot and game of thrones, but this show definitely has the best plot twists in fiction. And the way they're executed is truly unique.

4. This show has the best and most complex story/storyline in any movies, games and shows. The way Hajime Isayama connects the dots and leaves no plot hole, is truly unnatural. This story is unique and expands over 2,000 years. In the beginning, we get to meet Eren and humanity inside the walls, but at the end of the show, it went from a small and limited TV-show, to a show with the most extraordinary story and character developement. It's crazy to see where they got the series from the beginning of S1 to the end of S4. In S4, there are is a war with two oppisong sides. We get to learn everything about both sides and I've never seen a fanbase so divided and unsure who the bad guys are and who the good guys are. This is called perfect storytelling and we get to see why there aren't any good, or bad guys in a war.

5. Eren has to be one of the most well written characters of all time. Isayama takes us on a journey where we first meet Eren, this 10-year old boy who wants to join the survey corps and travel to the outside world to fight the titans. We all felt bad for him at the end of episode 1, but at the end of S4, people don't know how to feel about this mastermind, war hero, war criminal, victim. The crazy plot twists we get to see in the ""memories of the future"" and ""from you, 2,000 years ago"" changes our view on the entire series and the main character. We got a feeling that everything we watched was a lie and it blew our minds away.

I can name many more reasons as tho why aot is the greatest piece of fiction oat. E.g. The fights, the atmosphere, the world building etc.

This is a 10/10 show for me.",11,6,"Jan 23, 2023"
10,best anime,"Attack on Titan is an anime that is at its best by utilizing its worldbuilding and dark themes the best way it can.

10,Must watch anime,"If you like to watch anime and you haven't seen Attack on Titan, you should! Such a beautiful story with great fighting scenes. If you are new to anime, Attack on Titan is a perfect anime to start with. It sure is worth your time.

Slow paced first season, because there are so many unanswered questions. Second season teases you with some answers but brings up more questions, but the fighting is more exciting than the first season. Third season is a masterpiece without a doubt. Episode 16 has one of the best scenes in TV-show history. ""Does it mean our lives where meaningless?""",6,2,"Mar 4, 2019"
10,One of the best shows i've ever seen,"Attack on Titan is the type of show that leaves you wanting more. From the stunning animation, to the compelling story line, it really has it all.

The plot twists in this show have been among the best. Each time i would question how I did not see it coming and rewatching it would reveal all the hidden details I failed to see the first time. Its one of the few shows that I enjoyed watching even more the second time.

The story has many layers and the plot progresses to a point where, by the time I reached season 3, i was amazed at how deep the story really was. Each season is better than the last and everything about this show is beautiful and just something I wish i could experience for the first time again.

An absolute much watch. I cannot say much about the story without revealing the plot, but it does go much beyond the basic 'Man vs Beast' premise it starts off with. An overall 10/10.",6,2,"Feb 20, 2023"

9,Great entertainment,"I really enjoy AoT. Had to come on here to vent about having to wait at least a year for the ""final season"" to conclude! Jesus how can a season take 3 years to finish?

Now I have an anime hole that will be hard to fill as I find most of the other popular animes too childish to stick with. Most lack the quality of storytelling/character depth of AoT.",6,2,"Apr 5, 2022"
10,Who should give this a try,"I will start with the fact that if you give this anime a try, you should watch it until the end. This show is one of those where things that may see dumb at first suddenly 40+episodes later are properly explained and it all starts making sense. You get a one puzzle piece each season, but the sample of how the puzzle should look like is only showed to you fully in s04.

The show has great fights, a lot of surprises and a mystery aspect to it. The wide cast allows the author to freely kill of as many as the story needs.

Now to who should watch: Anyone who doesn t mind a bunch of character dying on him and has time to actually give this show a proper chance by not stopping before s04part1.

I am really higlighting the time thingy, coz I was one fo the people who saw AoT as a pretty average show until s04. S04 did change my mind on how I view the whole series quite drastically.",6,2,"Dec 3, 2021"
10,My review:,"First time I watched this show I though it was childish, then I realized that I've enjoyed every single moment in this show, I very grateful that I watched it, Thank Isyama and the co-writers, Thanks for wit studio and Mappa , thanks for voice actors, and sound engineers, This show is a masterpiece, in my own opinion it's the greatest show of all time, I watched GOT and BB and other shows, but non of these could reach what AOT reached after all this years of hard work and animating and doing the manga stuff, the soundtracks are so unreal, the characters of this show, the plot twist its perfect .",6,2,"Feb 20, 2023"
8,Second to none!!!!,A show like this is made once in a lifetime. I'm so lucky to be alive now and be able to watch this masterpiece.,6,2,"Feb 9, 2021"
10,A perfect 10 masterpiece in almost every single category,"It is extremely rare for a series to hit a perfect 10 in almost single category that you would use to rate a show. Alongside Breaking Bad, Shingeki no Kyojin sits in this league.

Plot and writing - extremely tight and well-constructed writing and dialogue. the story tells very big and complex ideas and lands it with precision without feeling too try-hard. the plot feels like it develops naturally as a result of the world and the actions of the characters rather than it being propelled by where the author demands it to go. it has massive internal consistency, with twists and reveals being planned years in advance which are 100% unexpected and yet make complete sense in retrospect.

Characters - it has a wide ensemble cast with very distinct personalities and world-views. its antagonists and protagonists are very well fleshed out with their own personal internal conflict and each character always acts in a consistent way that you would expect of them to.

Visuals - not only is the animation gorgeous, but its artistic direction is just top-notch. the way certain shots are framed, lit, slowed-down, sped-up, are all extremely effective and deliberate and stylistic.

OST - the music in this show is just off-the-charts phenomenal. in fact i think it plays a huge part in the success of this series. it will make you cry, cheer, scream with enthusiasm. the music is just down right sick.

World-building and lore - the story starts out very small and microscopic at the start but it eventually increases in scope and ambition. I must say that this series has one of the most original and fascinating lore and world-building I've seen in awhile.",6,2,"May 27, 2019"

10,Attack on Titan is Peak Fiction,"""Attack on Titan"" stands as a testament to what can be achieved in the realm of storytelling, marking it as a pinnacle of modern fiction.

It's a series that excels in numerous aspects, including its mind-blowing plot twists, well-crafted character arcs, profound themes, captivating music, stunning animation, intricate dynamics, meaningful parallels, and remarkable character development. These elements come together to create an immersive and thought-provoking narrative that keeps viewers engaged and leaves a lasting impact. In ""Attack on Titan,"" every twist and turn of the plot keeps the audience on the edge of their seats, while many characters undergo significant development throughout the series. Themes of freedom, sacrifice, and the cyclical nature of violence add depth, and the music score by Hiroyuki Sawano enhances the emotional resonance of key moments. The animation quality is consistently top-notch, and the dynamics between characters and the clever use of parallels enrich the storytelling. All these factors contribute to making ""Attack on Titan"" a standout in the world of fiction, earning it the title of Peak Fiction.",6,2,"Sep 11, 2023"

10,A masterpiece..,The best thing about this anime that it just keeps getting better and better .. it would never disappoints you .. whatever your expectation is .. it is better .. it just keeps you interested and leaves you hungry for more .. and when you think that it can't be better than this .. the soundtrack will blow your mind .. a masterpiece for the ages and believe me when i say this anime will break a new ground for people who think animes are a joke ( i used to think like that ) .. thank you mr. isayama ..,6,2,"Jun 1, 2019"
10,PEAK FICTION SPOTTED,"How do we feel when we write one of the greatest plots of all time? You don't know? Ask Hajime Isayama. Because, for sure, Attack on Titan is one the greatest Animated show of all time.

There is a high probability that people will still be talking about it in 10 years, the reason is that it's timeless. There is to much thing to talk about: the foreshadowings, the fact that EVERYTHING matters is really impressive and incredible. Most of the characters are unforgeable, and amazingly written have a development with no flaw. The soundtrack is already iconic, I love these songs so much. And of course, MAPPA and Wit did a really good job at the animation, it's gorgeous, dynamic, fluid, it looks so good. I'm not sure if one day I'll experiment something like that.",6,2,"Jul 22, 2023"

10,Amazing,"One of the best animes/mangas ever created. The characters are original and very likable. The animation and voice acting are amazing, too. The plot itself is original and perfectly executed. Each episode hooks you in further, and the outcome is unpredictable (aside from the identity of the female titan, which was pretty obvious in my opinion). The songs are high quality and catchy---I could never skip the openings or endings. As to how anyone could not love this masterpiece is beyond me. I recommend this show to anyone who enjoys exciting anime and isn't bothered by blood and light gore. AOT also includes many reoccurring themes that I think are important (for example, how fear can affect someone). One last thing I should note is that Isayama clearly put a lot of effort and time into this. Instead of just throwing it together using his previously known logic, he got some professionals in fields like engineering to figure out how this world works, like the 3DM gear and the horse breeds.",6,2,"Aug 3, 2017"
10,! unbelievable great !,"I've actually never been a fan of anime and I admit, it was a big mistake of me to make this my first because now I can't watch any other anime (or series) in this world without comparing it to this masterpiece. And unfortunately I know nothing will ever come close to this...

Now that this epic journey has come to an end, I don't know what else I can say about it except that it was an honor to have been able to experience it. Every single episode is an epiphany of entertainment and I as an author myself can't help but admire the creativity and narrative. This is the peak of human storytelling and I pity every story that comes after this one because nothing can ever come close to it.

Every episode is fantastic and I even have to praise the controversial ending. I'm happy with it and couldn't imagine any other logical path, even if some of the implementation made some people angry, it can't take away the joy of the rest.

I don't think anything in the world has ever influenced my life as much as this series and I am grateful for it. Thank you Isayama for all the lessons you showed us, thank you for all the feelings you brought out in me (damn I haven't cried like that in decades) and thank you to everyone involved.

That's my rating and I can't say anything more than praise and thanks. If you haven't seen the series, just watch it and stop reading my stupid praises. My praises are nothing compared to this.",6,2,"Nov 5, 2023"
10,AMAZING. The greatest SHOW I have ever seen,"Dare I say this was the best show I have ever watched. Yes, I am saying show because it is not only the best anime, but show in general. I have to thank my best friend for showing me this, because at first, I refused multiple times in wathcing it, but thanks to his persistance, I had the opportunity to have this unique view-changing experience throught this series. It's crazy how there is the division between the groups, yet, not really a wrong or right side, but rather points of view, which thanks to this amazing script there is no impaciality or bias, contributing very positively in analyzing and emotionally getting attached to many characters. I've never felt so confused and amazed psychologically by a show, and I have never cried wathcing a tv show, but this one made me cry like a baby. Thank you for providing this show for us. I absolutely love it.",6,2,"Dec 19, 2023"

10,A gripping and unforgettable thrill ride,"Attack On Titan has become a world wide phenomenon for a reason. It is one of the most epic, poignant, and breathtaking TV shows I have seen in years.

The storytelling of Attack On Titan is masterful in how it subverts viewer expectations and weaves an immensely captivating narrative that thoroughly grips the audience from start to finish. The plot of Attack On Titan is wholly unpredictable and full of mysteries. The show constantly finds interesting and creative ways to pull the rug out from under you and keep you guessing for it's entire runtime. Many shows attempt to create this feeling of uncertainty, but few manage to actually pull it off and keep it up as the show goes on. Attack On Titan does this in spades.

Throughout the story there are many huge revelations, plot twists, challenging decisions, and unforgettable moments that will completely take your breath away. The narrative also deftly evolves from a simple story of man vs nature to a complex and challenging allegory for how war corrupts the human soul.

Most of the characters in Attack On Titan are exceptionally well written and engrossing to watch. Characters such as Erwin Smith, Eren Yaeger, Levi Ackerman, and Reiner Braun are some of the most multi layered and fascinating characters I have ever seen on television.

Many of the characters are deeply flawed and morally grey, which helps to make them feel as human as possible. There are no clear good or evil characters in Attack On Titan and almost every character (including the characters you root against) has understandable motivations for committing their often heinous acts of violence. At times the show really makes you question who is right and who is wrong as well as who should survive and who shouldn't.

The action in Attack On Titan is entirely in a league of its own. There really is nothing like it. The battle scenes are so vibrantly animated and unbelievably fast paced to the point of being spectacular.

The show also establishes very early on that no one is safe in its world and that major characters can die. This adds an immense amount of weight to the battles, as you know that the lives of your favourite characters could be snuffed out in an instant.

In addition, the show undoubtedly has my favourite television musical score of all time. Almost every music track is unbelievably awe-inspiring to listen to and masterfully composed.

Moreover, the musical score is also incredibly diverse in its composition. Some tracks are hauntingly quiet and somber while others are bombastic and blood pumping, heightening the viewer's adrenaline to insane levels.

I have no doubt that some of the most emotional scenes in the show would not be nearly as effective if not for the music which speaks to how truly phenomenal the soundtrack is.

Overall, Attack On Titan is without a doubt one of the best shows of our time and will go down as a modern classic. It is a thought provoking, immensely entertaining, and riveting thrill ride. It grips your attention from the haunting opening episode and never lets it go until the end. Whether you are an anime fan or not, I would HIGHLY advise you to give this show a try. It may be one of the best decisions you ever make!",6,2,"Nov 9, 2023"

I will forever hold this show close I may even get a tattoo for this show it's perfect. Now my review needs 300 more characters so I will explain some crazy details the author ended the manga in 139 chapters and the number 139 has 3 additional details hidden within itself and the author runs with it the entire time every single plot twist (there's a lot) is foreshadowed so well you could rewatch the show 5 times and still find more I hope that this show will reshape the way you see the world.,6,2,"Nov 27, 2023"

10,Best piece of fiction,"**Title: Attack on Titan - The Magnum Opus of Fiction**

In the realm of storytelling, where narratives unfold, emotions are stirred, and worlds are created, few works have left an indelible mark as profound as Attack on Titan (AOT). As I embark on this exploration of why AOT can be considered the best piece of fiction ever created, it is essential to acknowledge the breadth and depth of its impact, transcending the boundaries of traditional storytelling to deliver an unparalleled narrative experience.

**I. A World Beyond Imagination: World-Building Excellence** At the heart of AOT's brilliance lies its extraordinary world-building. Creator Hajime Isayama meticulously crafted a universe where humanity lives confined within colossal walls, surrounded by mysterious, man-eating Titans. The intricacy of this world, from its societal structures to its history, is nothing short of breathtaking. The sheer scope and detail of AOT's universe immerse readers and viewers alike in a living, breathing world that defies imagination.

**II. Multifaceted Characters: Relatable and Complex** Great fiction often hinges on its characters, and AOT delivers an ensemble cast that is both relatable and incredibly complex. From the indomitable Eren Yeager, driven by his thirst for freedom, to the fiercely loyal Mikasa Ackerman and the intellectual strategist Armin Arlert, each character is a fully realized individual with their own motivations, fears, and arcs of growth.

The progression of these characters over the series is masterful. We witness their evolution from naive adolescents thrust into a cruel world to individuals burdened with the weight of their choices and responsibilities. Their growth is a testament to the richness of AOT's character development.

**III. Themes that Resonate: Freedom, Sacrifice, and the Human Condition** AOT's thematic depth is unparalleled. It explores profound themes such as freedom, sacrifice, and the human condition. The pursuit of freedom in a world where humanity is confined by walls and the threat of Titans becomes a driving force for the characters. The series raises essential questions about the lengths individuals will go to in their quest for freedom and the moral dilemmas they face along the way.

Sacrifice is another central theme, as characters grapple with the consequences of their choices and the price they must pay for their ideals. The human condition is laid bare, with the series delving into the darkest corners of humanity, from the cruelty of war to the capacity for hope and resilience in the face of despair.

**IV. Plot Twists and Narrative Mastery: Expect the Unexpected** One hallmark of exceptional fiction is its ability to surprise and challenge its audience. AOT is a masterclass in plot twists and narrative subversion. From the early revelation of the Titans' true nature to the mind-bending revelations about the history of the world and the origins of the Titans themselves, AOT consistently defies expectations.

The ability to keep readers and viewers guessing, to subvert tropes and clichés, and to create a sense of urgency and suspense is a testament to the narrative genius of Hajime Isayama. AOT's narrative keeps its audience on the edge of their seats, craving the next revelation and the resolution of its mysteries.

**V. Visual and Auditory Excellence: A Feast for the Senses** AOT's anime adaptation, in particular, has set a new standard for visual and auditory excellence. The animation quality, especially during action sequences, is nothing short of breathtaking. The terrifying visage of the Titans, the awe-inspiring maneuver gear battles, and the intricately designed world are brought to life with precision and artistry.

The soundtrack, composed by Hiroyuki Sawano, is a symphony of emotions that enhances every moment. From the hauntingly beautiful ""Vogel im Käfig"" to the adrenaline-pumping ""Attack on Titan,"" the music complements the narrative and amplifies its impact.

**VI. A Global Phenomenon: Impact Beyond Borders** What distinguishes AOT as a contender for the best piece of fiction ever created is its global impact. The series has transcended cultural and linguistic boundaries to become a worldwide phenomenon. It has sparked discussions, debates, and interpretations across the globe, fostering a global community of fans who engage with the series on multiple levels.

AOT's influence extends beyond the page or screen. It has inspired art, literature, music, and even academic discourse. It has resonated with audiences of all ages, backgrounds, and interests, making it a cultural touchstone that continues to shape the medium of manga and anime.

**VII. A Legacy for the Ages: Endurance and Relevance** The enduring legacy of AOT is a testament to its enduring relevance. Even as the series concluded, it left an indelible mark on the world of fiction. Its themes, characters, and narrative innovations continue to influence new generations of storytellers.

In conclusion, Attack on Titan stands as a pinnacle of fiction, a work that combines world-building brilliance, multifaceted characters, profound themes, narrative mastery, visual and auditory excellence, global impact, and enduring relevance. While the debate over the ""best"" piece of fiction will always be subjective, AOT's contribution to the medium and its impact on audiences worldwide make a compelling case for its inclusion in the conversation. It is a testament to the power of storytelling and the enduring impact of a masterful narrative.",6,2,"Sep 14, 2023"
10,A perfect anime,"This anime is simply amazing! The way it is animated, the story, the characters, the soundtrack, the thrill and the suspense make it in the top of my fav anime.",6,2,"May 5, 2022"
10,If you havent watched aot yet....WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?!?! GO WATCH,"No words could describe how spectacular and thought-provoking this anime is. Plot wise, animation etc...it's perfect in every single way. Definitely one of the best, if not the best, anime ever. This show holds a very special place in my heart and always will. I truly believe that this deserves a 10/10 rating, it's written and animated so beautifully, you get so immersed into the story. Hajime isayama is undoubtedly a genius writer, the way the characters are portrayed, and their character developments, FANTASTIC. Animation is wonderful too, both mappa and wit studios. DEFINITELY RECOMMEND!!!!",6,2,"Nov 6, 2023"
9,It made me feel gross and I love it,"I started watching this show when it started coming out and as a teenager at that time I did not appreciate the show and got bored in season 2 and stoped watching. Now the year is 2021, I start rewatching, a week later I'm caught up. The shows themes of humanity and government are very well executed but you can enjoy the show without focusing on those themes too. There's a lot of discomfort and every time I watched an episode I had weird dreams too because the horror of titans lingers with you and the show keeps you hooked. I recommend having a happy show to watch after tho.",6,2,"Mar 24, 2021"
10,Beautifully Crafted,"Admittedly, the first half of season one is slightly slow which is the only negative I have about the show. Every single part of it is relevant and the writers knew exactly what they were doing the entire time as there is so much foreshadowing and hidden details that watching it a second time is almost as good as watching it the first time. Some episodes have slow plots too that only build up the anticipation for big fights more, yet every episode is necessary to tell the complete story of the titans.",6,2,"Feb 23, 2022"
10,"To rise above normal stories, Isayama created 'Attack On Titan'","Attack On Titan is a masterpiece. The story is just great; it has a captivating start that will hook you from the beginning. And it only gets better.

The best thing about this anime is its characters. Each character is likable in their own unique way. They are not just good or bad, they all have their own ideologies.

Perhaps the only downside to this anime is its addictive nature.

The music is phenomenal, and the animation is superb. Every frame is a work of art.

The plot twists will always leave you shocked.

I understand that the ending may not be satisfying for everyone, but in my opinion, it was a good ending.

Overall, it's a 10/10 anime.",6,2,"Nov 12, 2023"

I started to watch it simply because of a friend of mine were nagging me about it. And I must say that I was hooked from the first episode of the series. Now the first season is all set and done. And I have some very simple things to say and that is that the artwork in this Anime is probably one of the best artworks I've ever seen, the drawings is just amazing, and the voice actors makes it feel so very much alive compared to a lot of Animes that I have seen. This is easily on my list of top 3 Animes that I have seen thus far. And I really, really must say that this is a must watch no brainer. I simply got to say that, if you haven't seen it, go see it.",14,9,"Sep 29, 2013"
10,Going ti be absolutely amazing,"Wow, I'm really excited for this show to become a huge success as a movie. I hope they widen their cast a little more to not just Asian roles since the manga says mikasa is the last Asian alive. But none the less this is going to be amazing guys. If this get good enough attention as well as designers and animations you can expect a lot of Titan followers to be behind this movie. I was super excited for pacific run but now I'm ecstatic to see this hit the big screens.

This was a great manga and the anime kicked it over the edge, I am really hoping this gets the support it needs to have as well as its chance to become big like the marvel movies. This would be an amazing movie and I would sure as heck buy it once it hit DVD:)",17,12,"May 27, 2013"
9,Peak fiction!!!,"One of the finest work from Japan. I made lot of memories throughout watching this. Many of my friends lost their interest because of the delays. But I couldn't find a way to ignore the final episode. I knew everything about the story by the grace of spoilers, still I wanted to experience it. I wasn't disappointed at all. I smiled, I cried watching it. But, ultimately I was inspired by the story and characters. I recommend everyone to at least give it a try hope you won't be disappointed. Everything about this show is great; the story, characters, music, visuals, plot and specially Eren. I wanna watch it again once I get old and forget most of it so that I can have the experience again.",7,3,"Nov 6, 2023"
10,Peak,AOT is the epitome of Peak. It is one of the greatest animes of all time. It is extremely forgiving for new anime watchers and is not hard to follow. AOT contains no filler episodes so you can watch every episode without wondering whether or not what your watching is for nothing.,7,3,"Feb 22, 2022"
10,Once and a while...there's that one anime.,"This is one of those anime's that come around once and a while that really makes you appreciate not only a good story, but the industry as a whole. This was one of the first anime's I've ever watched, and seeing as how season 3 is well under way, I thought I'd write a review.

This anime is really good, and I mean really good. The story, riveting and engaging. The characters, interesting and on point. The animation, action packed and just great. This was also the first anime to introduce me to Japanese manga.

I've kept up with the manga, which is way ahead of the anime, and some of the things that happen I cannot wait to see in this anime. Overall, if you're a first timer for anime, or need a good watch, then look no further than this show. You won't be disappointed.",7,3,"Aug 21, 2018"

10,PERFECTION!,"I love Attack on Titan, it is clearly one of the best anime in our generation and probably all time, especially when it comes to story and story telling, plot twist, character development, and overall animation of it. The finale is perfect for me, it is too realistic and relatable if we apply it in real life, Also, the consistensy of this show is pretty amazing and unbelievable too, because running a long time show is literally hard for author's to end. And there's no scene or thing that I would change in AOT, if I was given a chance to change everything, because it was perfect for me. I would like to Thank WIT studio, MAPPA studio and especially the author Hajime Isayama for this beautiful masterpiece.",7,3,"Nov 13, 2023"

One reason you can predict the anime story is that you are able to think about the various plots and predict it but this anime is amazing .. because it stops your thinking to predict the future and let you enjoy the anime i intensively.

Attack on Titan (AOT) has consistently proven itself as a remarkable masterpiece, with a storyline that has captivated audiences around the world. While there are countless reasons to praise this series, two standout elements that make it truly exceptional are the visionary storytelling and the character of Mikasa Ackerman.

Eren Was Right: One of the most compelling aspects of Attack on Titan is the complex character development, especially that of Eren Yeager. Throughout the series, Eren's character evolution is nothing short of a revelation. His journey from a young, idealistic boy to a character who challenges conventional notions of good and evil adds depth and moral ambiguity to the story. Eren's beliefs, actions, and his ultimate goals provoke thought-provoking questions about the nature of freedom, justice, and sacrifice. This moral complexity only adds to the depth of Attack on Titan's narrative and ensures that Eren Yeager's character remains a subject of debate and reflection long after the series concludes.

Mikasa's Unconditional Love: Mikasa Ackerman, on the other hand, is a character who has touched the hearts of many. Her unwavering love and dedication to Eren, as well as her commitment to protecting those she cares about, make her a character who stands out as a beacon of loyalty and devotion. Mikasa's character demonstrates the profound impact love can have on an individual and the lengths to which one will go to protect their loved ones. Her portrayal in Attack on Titan not only emphasizes her strength in combat but also her emotional strength, making her a character to be admired and cherished by viewers.

Unique Character in a Unique World: Mikasa's character, in many ways, embodies the central theme of the show - the relentless fight for survival in a brutal and unforgiving world. Her love for Eren and her determination to protect him and their friends is a symbol of hope and resilience amidst the chaos and despair that permeates the world of Attack on Titan. Mikasa's character is a testament to the idea that in a world where humanity is constantly under threat, the bonds of love and friendship can serve as a source of unwavering strength and motivation.

Masterpiece Storyline: Beyond the individual characters, Attack on Titan's storyline is a work of genius. The series masterfully combines elements of mystery, politics, and philosophy with intense action and emotional drama. It explores profound themes such as the cycle of hatred, the consequences of humanity's actions, and the price of freedom. The intricate plot twists and revelations keep viewers on the edge of their seats, while the world-building and history of the Titans add layers of depth to the narrative.

In conclusion, Attack on Titan is a true masterpiece, combining exceptional character development, thought-provoking storytelling, and a world filled with both darkness and hope. Eren's character evolution challenges conventional notions of morality, and Mikasa's love and unwavering loyalty exemplify the power of human connection in a harsh world. The series' storyline is nothing short of a masterpiece, weaving together multiple complex themes into a narrative that will continue to be loved and appreciated for generations to come.",7,3,"Nov 6, 2023"

From the use of the image ""Forest"", to ""the nature of man is always war and brutality"", ""the world is cruel but also beautiful"", or the author shows us each everyone has an ideal of their own, we cannot judge them right or wrong; even a great lesson for humans that it is a mistake to harbor hatred and then make our children suffer, which has led to an undesirable outcome.",7,3,"Mar 16, 2022"

Watch it and you will not regret it.",7,3,"Feb 14, 2022"
10,Best world building,"The show is basically told from the eys of the protagonist and as he matures , his perception does too and so does the show.

10,Best anime by a long shot,"This is the best anime I have ever watched by a very, very long shot. The story is so carefully crafted that no scene is irrelevant. Everything, and I mean EVERYTHING has a meaning, and is referenced later on in the series. The story seems to move slowly at some points, but again, EVERYTHING is there for a reason, and you realize later on now important those seemly innocent scenes were.

The story itself is quite tragic and messed up, and the more you watch, the more tragic it gets.",7,3,"Feb 12, 2022"

But my request to writer is please change the Ending, don't make it like manga.... Talking about suggestion, you should dub it in Hindi and some other Indian regional languages... because AOT has big fan following in India, but some people still don't know English...",8,4,"Nov 29, 2021"
10,The peak of fiction!,"I am not qualified enough to claim that Attack on Titan is the best animé ever made, but I can certainly say that this is the best experience I have had watching any animé.

What started off as a man Vs titan action series, soon became a philosophical juggernaut exploring themes of love, loss, war, genocide, politics, humanity, and much more. Started this series expecting to see some badass action, stayed with it because of the epic saga it became. AoT has one of the greatest fictional stories ever portrayed through the visual medium, a mature exploration of morally grey characters, and some of the most thrilling episodes ever. The ability of this series to evoke emotions and present such a thematically rich and thought-provoking story is unmatched.

I had first heard of this animé when it received huge praise for season 3 part 2 (the Return to Shiganshina arc is arguably the greatest arc of television history), but hadn't started watching it until late 2020 when the trailer for the ""final season"" was released. Fell in love instantly. Little did I know that I would have to wait 3 years for the final season to reach its conclusion. But the wait was worth it. The ending was not perfect, but it did not need to be to make me love it. I don't think any other show will ever be able to make me feel the way I felt while watching this. I will cherish this experience my whole life.

Favourite characters: 1. Erwin 2. Eren 3. Levi

Favourite episodes (there are a lot, but these are the top 5): 1. Memories of The Future 2. Hero 3. From You, 2000 Years Ago 4. The War-Hammer Titan 5. Perfect Game

10,Best Anime of All Time. Period.,"The think about animes are that they go a little too long, like you can take several examples, the issue is that the longer they go, the quality tend to get worse, but with Attack On Titan, the thing is different, the anime has 80+ episodes and have to say this, no matter what episode you randomly pick, you will not be disappointed ever, and it is a suggestion, try not to get too attached with the characters, 'cause, you know, i don't have to explain such stuff.

Along with this, the visuals are a treat to the eyes.

Just try to avoid spoilers, 'cause the plot twists are fire.",8,4,"Feb 21, 2022"
10,Japan's Equivalent to The Walking Dead,"Yes, sorry for the cheesy title (maybe ripped off some other reviews) but it's true. In my opinion it's even better than The Walking Dead. If you like action, thriller, mystery mixed in with some drama then this is perfect for you. If you are very easily emotionally impacted by movies then you're gonna need a box of Kleenex with you because you are gonna be making it rain tears. The anime is probably my most favorite anime out of all of them. This one just hits all the right pointers.

If you are deciding on what version to watch (sub or dub), it would depend on your concentration skill. If you are concentrated enough, that Japanese audio you won't understand isn't gonna distract you from reading the sub then go for it. If you are to do something else at the same time like go through Facebook, for example, I would recommend to watch the dub which all you need to concentrate on is the audio.",9,5,"Dec 24, 2014"
10,Spectacular,"First off I wanna say despite how the manga ended the anime (as far as it has covered) has been nothing but Amazing. Who is right? Who is wrong? What is right? What is wrong? These are the questions the characters are always trying to answer. In the end no one is right or wrong. Everyone are just soldiers trying to survive the cruel world in which they were born. The Anime is especially terrifying because of how much it is able to mimic the real world and our History........

Of course last but not least, Eren Yeager. What a beast of a character and what a protagonist. Eren will go down as one of the greatest protagonists of all time despite anyone's opinion on his actions.",9,5,"Feb 15, 2023"

10,Enjoyed every minute,"This is an excellent series. I don't normally watch anime I'm 23 and I used to watch dragon ball z as a kid which I re-watched recently. I still rate that as one of the best series I've ever watched. This stood out to me due to the reviews and praise I had heard about it. I thought I would give it a shot and I'm so glad I did. The story is immense hooks you straight away. The only downside to it is the episodes seem a little to short, so I got through season one in about 3 days. It is action packed, the characters are very unique with their individual traits and very interesting. It just keeps you wanting to go back they know how to end each episode to make you want to see the next. It's a very satisfying series, it has everything I like in it. I really liked the connection that Mikasa has to Eren which adds a lot to the emotions felt throughout the series. I did find the shouting some of the characters, particularly Eren do rather annoying at times though. All in all this is an excellent series and I will be watching other anime series now to feel the void until season 2!",10,6,"Jul 24, 2016"

Attack on Titan explores deep themes of freedom, sacrifice, and the cycle of hatred. It captures the struggles of humanity, the blurred lines between good and evil, and the heavy cost of survival. Every character, whether hero or villain, is layered with complexity, making us question our own morality. The storytelling is top-notch, with twists that keep you on the edge of your seat. A breathtaking journey from start to finish!"" What I watched was more than just a TV show-it was a mirror of how we think and treat each other as human beings. Attack on Titan dives into deep and raw truths about freedom, fear, and how far we're willing to go to protect what we believe in. I always hesitated to watch this series, but now I see how powerful it is. It resonates on so many levels, and I know I'll watch it again and again.

10,masterpie,"Watched since 2013, read the manga (most of it) and I can just say this is a show that will go down as one of the greatest pieces of media ever. Every single part besides season 1 is always consistently great, innovative, or at the very worst just good at doing what it's suppose to. The characters are all well written and can carry the show from Armin to characters like Ymir and Hange who don't get a ridiculous amount of screentime but are memorable nonetheless, especially Ymir. The world is fleshed out and makes sense. It's cruel and destructive, but can be beautiful at times much like our world. It's rules are set in stone and don't get broken, and everything seems like its connected and makes sense.

The best part is how the show keeps you so on edge with every move, as these characters aren't immortal and the odds they face are immeasurable. Many berate season 1 for the deaths of people who have literally 0 characterization but this is fixed later on with the deaths being a punch in the gut every time it happens which is pretty often.

Watch. Watch it. Now. Drop everything and watch this show.",4,1,"Feb 2, 2021"

Gorgeous drawing, original plot, unexpected twists and turns what is happening, living, relief characters, which were fully disclosed in twenty-five episodes - all this just stunned me.

Dynamic action scenes of battles with giants On the UPM they look just wonderful. I never loved fast fights in cartoons - I never did not have time to follow the action, but that's all Clear and detailed, so much that you have time worry about each participant in the battle.

By the way, do not worry, thinking that everything is with the heroes it will be good - stupid. Here you can die EACH. There's not enough inspiration Strength, training, main characters - far away not supermen, they make mistakes, they Get seriously injured, they die.",4,1,"Jan 19, 2022"
10,Masterpiece,"The Best thing I ever Saw AOT is such a good and high quality Anime/Series.

It's much more than a good anime it's the best series that exists on the market at this point.

The plot came out really surprisingly and good, all characters were written really well.

The world building was also excellent!

I rewatch it 4 times and every time it hits the same, all of the fights were extreme interesting and unique.

The characters are all really detailed and had their own story behind them it, it was interesting to know each single one of them better, to see their backstory, see their dream, it all made you closer to the character.

I don't know why the ending becomes so much hate, I think it fits the series perfectly, it was really emotional!

The soundtracks are so, so good it's epic and also it's just sounds good and fits the series so well, as a native German it's also nice to hear my nativ language in such a masterpiece.

I would recommend this series for everyone who wants to laugh, cry and cheer along with the best series ever made!

10,A masterpiece,This show has everything to be called a masterpiece. Absolutely no plotholes and the script is unbelievably good. Just go and watch it right now.,4,1,"May 30, 2021"
10,Excellence in every aspect.,"I'm no critic, but I can't not say something about Attack on Titan after finishing it's 3rd Season. I am a casual anime watcher and I picked up Attack on Titan as I had heard it was popular in the anime community. I flew through it in a couple of weeks - this show did more than grip me; it was all I could think about for the 2 or so weeks that I watched it and for a long while after that.

Attack on Titan manages do do what few other anime can do for me by taking an already interesting premise and expanding on it in ways I could never imagine. This is not just a surface level war between giant humanoid monsters and humans but also a highly realistic and realised world. There's a hierarchy, politics, religion, different corps with different roles, realistic defences, the list goes on. It's gritty and grounded (or not with the ODM gear), that's what makes the show so appealing to me as a viewer.

On top of this world that is rich and detail and realism, WIT studio have managed to earn my respect as some of the best animators Japan has to offer. Every frame has clearly had effort put into it and the action sequences flow with style and finesse of which I didn't think was possible for an animated TV show. This is all complimented by a score that doesn't falter to give me goosebumps during some of the climactic scenes of the show.

My only criticism of the show would be that it is quite hard to follow the lore and understand certain aspects as they are pushed onto you quite quickly later on in the show. You must make sure to pay close attention to the show because missing something could mean you lose yourself. Although it just an excuse for me to watch the show again so i'm fine with that. Additionally, I had watched the Dub for the first few episodes but I found the Sub to seem more genuine so I started again with that. Sub v Dub is all subjective though so I recommend watching Ep1 with both and seeing which you prefer.

Again, not a critic so I don't even know what i'm saying but if you're on the verge of watching this show then I assure you you might just find your next 10/10.",4,1,"Nov 28, 2019"
10,Amazing and Thought Provoking,"I am, by no means, a connoisseur of anime, and certainly not manga. What I can tell you is that Attack on Titan is simply brilliant. The only possible criticism I can amass is that the show tends to milk dramatic moments, which may dissuade some viewers, but from the few animes I have watched (particularly dramas, like Death Note), this seems to be a norm. Thematically, this show is unparalleled. The characters, though quite one dimensional at first, see an exponential and satisfying development up until the very final season, which is now being released. The world and lore is enriched and full of mystery, not to mention the outstanding action sequences, incredible artwork, perfect humour and pure horror that comes with watching massive naked humanoid cannibals. I could not recommend this show enough, it only gets better and better!",4,1,"Dec 21, 2020"

9,"All good elements combined, perfectly balanced","Fun. Tragic. Lovely. Painful.

All of humane and realistic emotions we can possibly imagine are combined with inhumane and occult topics, and these are combined so well, it leads to an intense immersion. And these inhumane and unrealistic topics, about killing titans and ancient myths, change into realistic and humane political war with tremendous plot twists and foreshadows.

It has so many episodes, and they used this advantage to focus on every characters, not only the main characters. All of the characters have humane backstories. No matter how strong and invincible he looks, he has tragic backgrounds. No matter how miserable and painful they look, they have reasons to survive till the end. This makes viewers empathetic and immerse to the show.

But the strong points of this show are not only about plot, story and emotion. It also presents epic soundtracks, intense action, and perfect camera angle. The 'OVA gear', which is made for killing titans, is so appropriate for animated action. These four elements are combined so well, they'll blow the viewers' mind away in every action scenes.",4,1,"Feb 18, 2023"

10,My feelings,"I didn't watch anime at all before. After the wonderful adaptation of Attack of the Titans, I really liked this genre!

Generally Attack of the Titans is a Japanese post-apocalyptic manga written and illustrated by Hajime Isayama.

At the center of the events are 3 friends who have to face the most unusual events for their age. Their history consists in making difficult decisions about the outcome of which no one can assume anything. This story is about friendship, betrayal, and even yourself. There are no culprits here.

A story about a love that no one saw, but everyone fought for it.

A story filled with self-deception and self-sacrifice.

10,One of the greatest anime,"The most luxurious thing. Not for everyone, of course. But not everyone will watch melodramas either.

I love everything about this anime. The universe, characters, events are clearly worked out.

Everything looks real and lifelike. There is a war going on. And there are always many deaths in war.

It is interesting that the enemy is not only there, behind the walls, but also here. Internal strife, division into estates. Everything is like in life.

Music at the highest level.

The opening of the first season is just beyond words.

And, of course, Corporal Levi. My favorite character. I could praise him for a long time, but we will continue. All characters are revealed to the maximum. It is interesting to observe not only the main ones.

The characters are so well-developed that you become invested in their journeys from the very first episode. The show's exploration of themes such as identity, betrayal, and sacrifice is both thought-provoking and heart-wrenching.

10,A story like this a generational masterpiece and cannot out done even if tried.,"I have watched quite a few TV shows, Anime, Movies, and played games on ps4, and all considered there's isn't a form of media entertainment greater than the world created by the writer.

The story, the narration, the plot twist, the pain, the feeling of wanting to scream with Erwin, this show has it all and for me everyone should atleast once experience this gem.

People often precieve anime as child's stuff and not think highly of people who watch it, but this thinking often limits their scope to enjoy a story which would be pratcially as enjoyable if was a show.

Would recommend this series to everyone. I have watched all of famous TV shows but nothing kept me on the edge of the seat like Attack on Titan. Not only entertaining but it also touches upon some series topics of Societal issues but one needs to be open minded to view things.

10,One of the most epic stories ever told,"The only thing standing between Shingeki no Kyojin and perfection was its extremely dilated airing. Today, we have at last the option of watching this story from start to finish uninterrupted and it can not be more beautiful.

The thing that stands out the most here is the bravery of this story. Fearless of being cruel and an ode to despair and futility. Because what can be more cruel than to give it all for your loved ones and receive no rewards sometimes even no recognition. What sensation can overcome the despair of uselessness. What can be more futile than our struggles to no end.

Sometimes (many times) there is nothing good at the end of the road, sometimes our efforts do not bear fruit. We are caught in the wheel of change thinking that we can be part of meaningful movements that are going to change humanity. Every last one of them are just grains of sand in a huge coastline that is human nature. We can not change, we would not change.

This masterpiece is now completed for us to realise that even in despair and hopelessness... there is beauty.",5,2,"Nov 6, 2023"
10,My review,"The anime is very beautiful, with plot, excitement and revenge. You can't predict what any character will do, and expect any character to die at any time. The scenario is wonderful and completely unexpected, and you may hate a character you used to love and vice versa. In the third season, there will be a radical change in the story, and the ambitions of the heroes will differ from what they were in the first and second seasons. The change will not only be in the events, but the characters themselves will gradually change their behavior.

You will experience many emotions such as fear, happiness, sadness, etc. It's not about love, not about high school life, it's about freedom.

Usually when the main mystery is revealed in a show it's not interesting anymore but this show has jaw dropping revelations in every episode. I usually don't write reviews but this show is sooo good I feel like it's my duty to review it. Trust me if you watch this show you won't be disappointed. Don't skip it thinking oh it's just animation so won't be interesting.

This is the first anime series that I have fully completed, both the anime and manga. I've always been so curious what the story behind all of those titans, the people outside the walls, and I can never guess what will happen in the end.

Hajime Isayama made a very good story, I feel that ""Shingeki no Kyojin"" positioned on the giants of anime, and has very well deserved. The opening songs are also very good and epic as expected of Revo. He is a musical genius, Sawano too. Hiroyuki Sawano OST is also very good and epic. Hajime Isayama, Revo and Hiroyuki Sawano, the perfect combination to make this epic. I think people who do not see animations should give an opportunity to shingeki no Kyojin, the stories of the manga and anime are mostly very good.",5,2,"Jan 5, 2016"

10,Exceptional Anime.,"I don't understand why most of the people did not like this anime. This might change your point of view about ""Shingeki no kyojin"". First of all the video quality the sharpness and the details are amazing. They are doing the work so delicately taking care of every detail is very had job but in the episodes it seems it is easy to draw and all. We must appreciate the art and the artist.

Almost every Japanese anime's story line is so carefully built. But I've got to say the suspense in this one is blowing my mind away it's like they are giving my brain a shock treatment by revealing the suspense after some time. It is really a masterpiece.

I don't care what others say this anime is worth giving a try.",5,2,"Aug 10, 2018"
10,So i've seen so many animes in the past and believe me this anime is really worth the watch.,So this anime is really one of the most serious and intense anime out there.U can see in the description that titans are the ones who are trying to destroy humanity and as the story goes on u'll know more and more about this mysterious creatures.AOT has a really strong storyline and it will keep u binded in its every episode.One of the best thing about AOT is that its story is so strong that u will keep guessing and will always be curious to know whats gonna happen next. I can only tell you this much coz you have to watch it for urself if u want to live this anime. WITHOUT A DOUBT GO FOR IT,5,2,"Jun 20, 2017"

10,Simple yet complicated plot put beautifully by studios,"The series is one of the biggest ones that put the anime genre on the map today , and there is good reason to it . The storytelling is impeccable, so is the animation quality to even change in narration tone for the story - but its the characters that make the series unforgettable. And Isayama nailed it with the protagonist turned anti-hero/antagonist whose plot twist actually as surprising as Harry Potter series. It is rare to see a series that actually is able to successfully portray coming of age behaviour in such a beautiful way despite showing taboos of abuse and suicide . Definitely one of the top tier series of the genre that has set a standard for the entire game.",5,2,"Sep 11, 2023"

9,"An elegant, thrilling show mostly deserving of the hype","When you cast away all the flavor and skin, at it's core it's a story about heroes which fight the bad guys, odds always stacked against them. That being said, the setting is very gripping, clever, and subtly hints at relevant and serious themes. Characters are lovable but don't feel like they get much development beyond the setup values they are assigned at the start. Yet still, I cared very much about them and my stomach was twisting as I was watching what was going to happen to them next. Which pretty much sums it up. Even if, at times, it doesn't offer much in term of complexity when you try to dissect it and analyze it, it is thrilling to experience. It's the best distraction I afforded myself this year.

Some Pros:

Great setting. Nice visuals, even if at times a bit too bloody, with a very attractive combat style, great music which follows it well and promises quite some nerd-chills. The way titans are colored, their facial expressions just make them exceptionally creepy, as if they walked down from a weird modern art piece. They only add more to the special atmosphere of the show.

Some Cons:

Untimely internal monologues which can eat up nearly whole episodes. The very short episodes, not even 20 minutes of original material per, create inappropriately small chunks for how slowly the story progresses at times. I watched it all at once, but I can imagine it being a bit frustrating to endure through so many cliffhangers. Combat feels like it is driven by personal ""anime awesomeness"" skill rather than teamwork or some other clever aspect a tad more often than I'd like. It feel like there was a missed opportunity here to avoid falling into that mold.

Overall, it's a elegant take on action packed anime. I personally recommend it. You should be bought by episodes 4~5. Oh, and I recommend watching it with the Japanese audio if you don't mind reading subtitles, the English dub isn't so great as actors they picked don't match their characters very well.",5,2,"Dec 18, 2014"

9,The Attack Titan,"My friends always kept telling me this, ""You need to watch AOT, it's not like most animes, it's different"" After a long time insisting, I said, ""Okay, I'll watch it"" I'm here to tell you they were right.

Attack on Titan is that kind of show that gets better as long as you keep watching. It demands commitment. The first season is probably gonna suck, full of unnecesseary plotlines, overused dialogue, so-so action scenes. It's not bad, it's okay. The second one gets a little better, with some major twists and better pacing, and some really amazing scenes. But the third one...

The 3rd season of AOT is where WIT studio proved that they adressed most of the problems Attack on Titan had in the past, and from that, we get the best season of the anime. Full of strong action sequences, interesting plotlines, interesting new themes. They really learned with their mistakes and made AOT better. Hero, is one of my favorite episodes from any TV show ever.

Now, let's address the change of studio in season 4. There will always have people who will say that changing studios didn't affect the quality of the anime. I, personally, think I would be lying if I said that, cause It clearly did. Overused dialogue, overused CG, weak action scenes. What really sustains this season is the plot, which is amazing. I have to commend both Isayama and the writers from MAPPA, when it comes to the story and characters. Season 4 is a big turn on AOT and will be worth you time. Now, I didn't hate this last season's part 1, I enjoyed it. But, it was inferior to what WIT studio was able to accomplish in 3 seasons.

However, I would be wrong to say that all of those issues are there for lack of commitment with the material. MAPPA had a tight schedule to make the last season, and they did a pretty amazing job considering that. I still hope that they use less CG in part 2 of this last season, cause it really affects the action scenes.

Attack on Titan is a ride. You'll care about the characters and be engaged with the story. It is not only a good anime, but also, a great TV show. By watching this, you'll be doing yourself a favor. Seeing a show like this one, is a rare thing.",5,2,"Mar 29, 2021"
10,Watch it on a BIG screen and i bet you will cry the day it ends!,"Don't watch 1)In a hurry 2)on small screen 3)while pooping 4)if you haven't already watched some starter anime. These aren't all starters but are good for a pre AOT warm-up - TheSevenDeadlySins, OnePunchMan, FMA , FMA brotherhood, Parasyte, BNHA, Tokyo Ghoul, Dragonball Z(don't watch 'Super'!! You might stop watching anime altogether), Golden time, Avatar, Deathnote, Mob Psycho 100, Assassination classroom, Death Parade) 5)Dubbed, watch in subtitles, that's the true vibe, only true anime fans know why!! 6)if you think pokemon, doraemon are real animes 7)while not at peace and at full ease, focus, and mood to sum it up!!

Some anime to watch after AOT -Mirai Nikki, Shigatsu wa kimi no uso(in the last episode you might feel it is even better than AOT, it's a totally different genre though), Clannad

Also try watching only one season or maybe just a set of episodes which don't have some big suspense in the next episode, and mix with one more anime.I generally do so with one short and one long anime.",5,2,"May 10, 2019"

For the anime itself, it's not a kind of anime which works out for good animation, Attack on Titan is purely greatest of all anime for it's insane storyline and foreshadowing. I am glad that I was alive for all these years to finally see this anime end with my own eyes. It's been a great journey watching this anime. This anime has everything a show could ever have. Some people didn't like the manga ending but the anime ending is far better.

The only bad thing is that you'll probably lose some sleep over it because all you'll want to do is find out what happens next. Believe me, I was probably up till 2 or 3 in the morning watching episode after episode. But never mind that, who needs sleep anyway when you have THIS MAGNIFICENT AND DELICIOUS CREATION to spend all of your time on, right?",9,6,"Nov 26, 2013"
10,"This whole show is an ""Advancing Giant""","I have to say I'm not always an anime guy...but ohhh my gosh this series will have you at the edge of your seat. Phenomenal, action packed, mature, light hearted when it needs to be...the suspense will leave you hanging in every episode and will answer at least some of it in the next one, which makes this whole thing pretty much spoiler heavy. Everything is top notch. So much so that I don't even know where to begin.

With America's current obsession with doom, gloom, and hopelessness along with post-apocalyptic (zombie related) stuff (i.e. The Road, The Last of Us, The Walking Dead etc.) it really is no surprise that this came out as a smash hit. Just look at Tumblr. When you see anything SNK related, the first thing you'll probably notice is how varied it is and the amount of notes it gets. Compare that with other Japanese animations that gets reblogged and you can't help but be happy with the amount of success it achieved for itself. In other words, you may not like the show, but you have to appreciate the recognition it gained here in the states if you're an anime fan, which I believe no anime has ever done before. With that being said, you owe it to yourself to give this one a chance, especially if you're into anything like the shows/movies I've just mentioned!

Also, one thing I'd like to add is that isn't it refreshing to see that it's giants devouring humans this time around, instead of the usual brain-eating zombies?

Anyway, if you allow me to suggest...don't watch this at night. Nine times outta ten, you're most likely going to binge watch it. Coming home one day ready to relax before I go to bed, I decided to check this out and watch only ""one"" episode due to a friend who suggested this to me months before. 7 hours later I ended up hating myself and that made it harder for me to catch some z's. It's gotten to the point where I had to ask my neighbor for this powerful tea to help keep me awake after only getting about 1 to 2 hours of shut eye. Despite the agony the people felt that had to wait a week before a new episode came out, at least you didn't go to bed hating yourself and thinking about every other regrettable life decision you've made prior.

So yeah, for real, don't watch this at night. Unless you're free and have some more free time afterwards.

This show is pretty damn awesome.",8,5,"Mar 31, 2014"

10,"""For as long as people hold firm to different beliefs, there will always be an enemy.""","""Shingeki no Kyojin"" is a must-watch TV series. It had a profound impact on me unlike any other show or series I've encountered. Its magnificence resonates through every aspect, from the remarkable character development, intricate plot, and conflict, to featuring one of the most compelling protagonists in anime history-Eren Yeager.

A huge shoutout to Hajime Isayama, WIT, and MAPPA studios, and all those involved in its creation, for their unwavering dedication and hard work.

Shinzo wo Sasageyo!!!",6,3,"Nov 6, 2023"
10,Complete Masterpiece,"Attack On Titan is very easily one of the greatest storylines I have ever come across. I am so grateful to have had this so highly recommended to me. Originally, due to the hype at the time I didn't believe that it was something that I personally would enjoy, so for a long time I postponed watching it until a friend sat me down and got me to watch episode one and from there, the rest was history. I can assure you that going into this show blindly is one of the few experiences that I wish to relive. For this show specifically, I don't believe that giving an overview is appropriate at all, it is best to just go straight into it from episode 1. Not an experience that anyone would regret.",6,3,"Nov 23, 2023"
10,best anime,"Most of the time I prefer to watch American series instead of anime. But Attack on titan (AOT) is different. It has an exciting story and it made me to watch more than 5 episodes some days.

At the end I suggest you to watch this series on time in your life.",6,3,"May 12, 2021"
10,Best anime to watch,"It continunes few days after where we left off last season and it focuses more on political drama and dilemmas inside the walls. This season gets straight to the point and introduces new villain named Kenny that turns out to be somehow related to Levi. There are many parties trying to get Eren and Historia. For what reason? It is yet to be reveald. Mystery we all feel in love with is still there and there are even more questions, but don't let that distract you from the fact that this season,even tho is only few episodes in, already has some major reveals in it. Pacing is amazing and i wasn't bored for a moment while watching. Things are only getting more interesting when Erwin reveals how he's planning to ovethrow the governmant without using the force. This season has a very refreshing and different plot compared to previous ones as we can see from the lack of titans and focuse on the issues inside the walls rather than beyond. However it's still as, if not more interesting than before. There is world buidling,mystery,back stabbing and some major questions answered which there is hopfully more to come.",6,3,"Jun 14, 2022"
10,One of the best animes,The plot of AOT is awesome... With outstanding sounds... So many characters and the scenes are awesome... How the story begins with humans stuck inside the walls.,6,3,"Apr 27, 2022"

10,Truly the pinnacle of human fiction.,"Started this show was I was 13 and it truly was perfect. From the OST, Openings and endings to outstanding character development and god tier foreshadowing. I believe this is an anime that even non anime lovers could sit down and enjoy. I think this anime truly shows how humans are prone to war and the the victims it truly affects. Watching it throughout the years I went from just enjoying the animation and cool fight scenes to seeing the story that was unfolding before my eyes, it was something that truly is a masterpiece. Isayama planned everything out from the very beginning and it shows, watching it a second time or more you can pick up many of the foreshadowing elements Isayama planted. I love it 10/10.",6,3,"Nov 13, 2023"
10,GODLY PERFECT,Just too damn good. U gotta witness it with your own eyes. No words can describe this Masterpiece. Watch it NOW!!!,6,3,"Jun 3, 2021"
10,A review for this piece of fiction.,"Attack on Titan is the definition of a literal masterclass work of fiction and media. This cruel and hell of a ""world"" provides an exceptional and sophisticated plot filled with despair along with furnished, exceptional, broken and twisted characters that possess profound ideologies, dynamics and goals. Moreover, the story it portrays maintains bizzare foreshadowing, as a result this enables the viewer to comprehend the complex and already set in stone events happening in each season. Finally, the theme of the show illuminates the ""gray"" atmosphere that is maintained with each character's beliefs, making no one wrong or right, this, along with the other aspects and elements of the show create cherished lessons about the pain of the world and human emotions that structure a deep place in your heart...",6,3,"Mar 7, 2022"
9,A Progressive Masterpiece,"when the creative filmmaker of rest of the world were busy making gold out of same plot for post apocalyptic story-line, Hajime Isayama took the storytelling to next level. when giant humanoid beings take over the world and humanity is at mare extinction, the only hope of survival is Giant Walls made by humans for their protection. when survival is protection and hope is just a metaphor.

When fear and cowardliness is wild spread, Eren Yeager, his adopted sister Mikasa Ackerman and childhood friend Armin Arlert, who join the military to fight the Titans after their home town is invaded and Eren's mother is eaten.

The best things about the anime is that it keep you at the edge of the seat while the story progresses, keeping the Titan's identity and origin unknown with spellbinding action.

One of the things that kept the constant titan hunt fresh was the character roaster. Though you'll mainly play as Eren, Armin, Mikasa, or Levi, there is a point where the campaign allows you to play missions as one of 10 characters, and each has their own combat style that matches their personality.

The fact that first five episodes are pretty straight and focus on character building and mainly history, then it takes a mind twisting turn. And perhaps we can't easily determine that at what time phrase the event is taking place.",6,3,"Nov 2, 2016"
9,So real and so good,"Manger reader writing this after watching S3 EP 16, to know that the story only gets better, more complex and intense is unbelievable. I am glad an anime I saw in 2013 and thought had great potential has done so well.

Although I am dying to read the last chapter of the manga, it will be a sad day when its finally over. Enjoy this anime because it is rare.",6,3,"May 24, 2019"

10,its great...,I love this...usually i don't watch anime but that.....oh my god it's fantastic.,6,3,"May 15, 2021"
10,BEYOND Anyone's expectations,"I mean....the rating speaks for itself. When a story tangles itself with our very emotions and we find ourselves totally immersed in it, it becomes something far more superior and far more complex than a simple story; it remains in our very core throughout our whole life. The ending of Shingeki no Kyojin made me cry, laugh and then cry again because I was longing for something more.....but I am not even a little bit of disappointed at how the story ended....because it was PERFECT, it was perfect to the very last sentence and even after that. The emotions and feelings along with the thrills that Attack on Titan has given to me over this past 10 years will always be a part of me. Thank you Mr. Hajime Isayama from the bottom of my heart for sharing this wonderful story with our world and creating a legend.",6,3,"Nov 13, 2023"

I don't want to give away tomuch but, but this is a series to watch even if you don't like anime because this is the first anime TV show I have watched and I love it. The show really makes me feel things that I have never felt for a TV show. But the story goes really deep then any TV show I have ever seen. The story is really intricate that only professionals could write a story like this. When you first watch it you might be like, oh it's just a giant wall protecting humans from Titans, simple it's not. By the first couple of episodes I was hooked.

9,Amazing and captivating !,"Attack on Titan is an action, adventure, drama, fantasy and horror TV Series, it's also an animation made by the Wit Studio and the Production I.G. in Japan. There are 25 episodes of each 24 minutes and 3 seasons which one with 2 parts.

The story is about a hundred years ago, humans were nearly exterminated by titans. Titans are typically very tall, semm to have no intelligence and devour humans beings, and, worst of all, seem to do it for the pleasure rather than a source of food. But a small percentage of humanity survived by walling themselves in a city protected by extremly high walls of 50 meters. The main character is a teenage boy named Eren Jaëger who wants to know the secret about the titans and extermine them. He is determined, most of the time arrogant and reckless. The mood is dark, calm and stressing.

I'm giving it 9 out 10 because i liked the ambiance of the serie and it captived me to know more about the titans and the history of the main character.",2,0,"Mar 5, 2020"

10,Absolute peak of cinema,"I'll start by saying that I've always been very skeptical about anime, even as a child I didn't watch any, maybe apart from a few episodes of Pokemon, but when I saw a video on YouTube explaining the plot of AOT, it intrigued me so much that I decided to watch it someday and I actually regret that I found out at least part of the plot of this masterpiece before watching it. I've watched many movies and series, but none of them have drawn me in with the world, characters and especially the brilliant idea for the plot and plot twists. The best thing is that everything was planned from the beginning. Already in the second scene of the first episode we have references to the events of season 4 (i.e. The season that will come out in 10 years from the release of season 1). It's also not an ordinary good action show because it also has many philosophical threads that make you think. Everything from the characters, plot, music and creation of the world is perfect. It is also a story that takes no prisoners, the heroes are not immortal as it happens in some series and they can actually die as a result of some events. To sum up, if you like a gripping non-linear plot with many twists, medieval atmosphere, philosophical moral dilemmas, or just good action, this series is perfect for you, so don't wait and start watching today and you will definitely not regret it.",2,0,"Oct 24, 2024"

10,my favorite anime,"For people who said that its ""over dramatic"", obviously it would be its an anime after all and not a real tv show with real actors so the animators and the writer wanted/made their faces and voices more dramatic so it gives a kinda realistic performance (and the story of course) and the story it self is a drama, and it may be as a motivation so the characters want to get revenge and stuff because they wouldn't normally just go and fight titans for no reason or bc its fun😐 and its not actually over dramatic there are a lot of ppl that had similar truama as some of the characters as christa, armin, mikasa and levi..",2,0,"Jan 31, 2021"

10,A normal guy review,"This anime changed my life , the story pacing is masterful, with constant twists and turns that will leave you on the edge of your seat. Characters who seem simple at first develop into some of the most complex and memorable personalities in anime. Eren Yeager, in particular, undergoes one of the most fascinating transformations of any protagonist, with the narrative pushing the boundaries of what it means to be a hero or a villain. The show consistently keeps you guessing, asking you to reflect on your own perspectives as it delves into themes of freedom, sacrifice, and the cycle of hatred. , it's not just an anime

I literally lived with the characters all this 11 years. , I wished that the ending was different but , it's not that bad actually , after I've rewatched attack on titan for the 16th time , it was making sense actually , so it's not that big deal. , anyways thank you isayama for this masterpiece.",2,0,"Oct 24, 2024"

10,Stunning Masterpiece,"I came across this series by pure chance when I accidentally clicked on the first episode of Attack on Titan.

And I can't be happy enough to have accidentally found this.

Many have already raved about this series, so allow me to add something else. In just thirty minutes of the first episode, Attack on Titan managed to make me fall in love with the realistically-portrayed main characters Eren, Mikasa, and Armin as well as the side characters. Already, I became emotionally attached to each one of them, and due to the story's setting of humans being titan's food, I feared for them to the point of tearing up.

I'm not typically one to cry watching anime, but this was a huge exception.

Eren is a young boy who is filled with vengeance. After an absolutely traumatic experience, he came to conclude that he wanted to slaughter every single titan in existence. His dream is laughable due to his obvious weaknesses and personality problems, and I love him precisely because of all his imperfections, which separate him from the main stream anime heroes with glorified personalities.

Mikasa is the character foil of Eren. She recognizes how weak Eren is, and is determined to protect HIM, who sometimes throws himself at every danger. I fell in love with her too upon seeing the delicate balance of sanity in her. She would've snapped if not for having Eren as a mental support.

Armin, a boy with a girlish face and ""weak"" personality, also became lovable when it was apparent that he had his virtues. What he lacks in strength he makes up in intelligence.

And then there's Jean. Oh Jean how I love him.

He's clearly disagreeable;and yet, he is also the manifestation of what normal humans were like back then. He fears for his life, and he is not afraid of voicing out his fears. When we all think he is away from the Titans for good, he surprises us with a sudden burst of bravery that stemmed from compassion for a comrade. In this way, he might just be my favorite character of the entire series.

There's also the public favorite: Levi.

Although he doesn't actually come into the picture until halfway into the series, he became an instant public favorite. Well, he is the strongest character in the series after all. He has certain quirks, which the fandom thoroughly showcased with fan-made videos, that make me laugh when I see him.

Anyways, overall this series is beautiful.",11,9,"Nov 25, 2013"
9,Meditative and Lyrical Anime,"Anime left the label of low budget syndicated animation--the era of Thundercats--ages ago. It is a visual media art form.

For visual media enthusiasts curious about anime, Attack on Titan is a superb example of the field, and as good a starting point as any for serious explorations.

The most arresting facet of this gem of Japanese animation is the depiction of sunlight. The drawn and colored sunlight is glorious, almost a character in the story unto itself.

And what a worthy story the sunlight joins, a coming-of-age hero's call of a tale that Joseph Campbell would recognize instantly.

The dialogue is rendered in Japanese. The version released to NetFlix mid-2015 has Englisg subtitles. These are unobtrusive and seem to be translated in a natural idiom. The rhythm of the dialogue and the spatial placement of the characters amidst their built environment easily tips to the influence of Kurosawa.

Like so many of the achievements, the artisanal films and series, in the anime oeuvre, Attack on Titan is a labor of love. The product of a group of artists.

Watch it for days on end, or for just a hour or so, and let the sunlight find you.",9,7,"Aug 20, 2015"
10,Greatest anime of all time your gonna want to watch it!,"Simply stunning I consider this to be amongst my top 3 greatest anime's of all time. Just the overall quality of this anime is like no other. The combination of symbolism, logical thinking, and intense action is so incredibly remarkable. I have never seen anyone put as much quality into an anime as this one. There is not one flaw in this show. I also love this show because it is so realistic unlike Bleach and Naruto (Don't worry I love those shows anyway). I am about to say after seeing all the episodes that this is the greatest anime of all time. Ahead of Death note, Dragonball Z, and Full metal alchemist. Don't believe me than just watch it!

10,Hooked,"I've seen a lot of anime and manga films and I have to say that this one of the best I've seen in a while. The art work is skillfully done IMHO and there is a lot of detail that you have to pay attention to to catch. I'm not one for putting in spoilers, so I won't include any; but you won't be disappointed. You have to look at this from a different perspective and not from a line of Naruto or something of that sort. It's not on the same stage.

I was hooked after the first episode. It's funny that I was looking for another show and found this one. I could not turn my eyes away. The powerful story line keeps you hooked.

I think I watched 19 episodes before I could turn my eyes away. It just kept getting better and better. It's not healthy to sit there and watch his many, but I'm hooked. It's going to be disappointing when I don't have any more to watch.",7,5,"Feb 6, 2014"
8,First anime after dragon ball z years ago,"I'm writing this review after only watching 9 episodes but if you're on the fence about trying this show or you want to get into anime like me, watch this show.

9,Tragic but great,No content,7,5,"Jul 24, 2021"
9,Incredible Feat of Story Telling,"This show is on another level of story telling. The original manga is amazing and the adaptation is breath taking. The story is fairly simple to follow and is filled with constant plot twists which make the story all the more interesting while entwining unique developments of depth and detail to the setting and characters.

The characters lack a bit of development, but who needs development here? The show isn't about psychology. It's an Action Thriller and it does it's job extremely well. The main characters all have strong foundations for their motives and relationships are well established in the series. Lines are drawn and boundaries are crossed in this series.

It's an excellent feat of story telling. What makes this show click though is it's rare ability to entangle the viewer in the universe of the characters. When I watched the show for the first time, the first thing that struck me was the painfully realistic approach at which the creators involve us in the story. It's a clean style of story telling that's simple to follow. It isn't a mystery show. It's a thriller like I stated.

I also have to give credit to the visuals and music. The animation is absolutely stunning in Attack on Titan and the music just enhances the glory and epic vibe of the show. I'm serious, some of the moments made my balls drop.",7,5,"Nov 25, 2018"
10,Amazing. Definitely one of the best animes to date!,"Lets be real, AoT is the next big thing to hit the anime scene. This review however is going to receive not helpful feedback though because of the four star rating, so lets go.

There's nothing wrong with the animation, music or any sense of production. That's all 10/10 no question. My problem lies with the source material believe it or not.

The story is straightforward, however it is effective and it is a good story. The problem is the pacing of the story. It takes too long to get anything done. The first major battle you might say in Trost, if I remember correctly is nine episodes. I feel like it could have been accomplished in five or six. It simply drug on too much. I hear the manga pacing is poor as well, and it seems like the anime might move faster than the manga actually, which is a good thing if that's true.

Characters are generally likable, although for the most part they fit shonen stereotypes. Headstrong main, with a friend who is much stronger initially than the main, and a friend who is resourceful and intelligent. This isn't to say they're bad characters, because they're not. I just would have preferred to see something a little different than what essentially is a revenge monster. It is deeper than that yes, but on the outside, that's essentially how I view Eren.

The last problem I have is actually what's going to draw many people to the series. And that's the ""Epic"" moments. Let me just say that these are NOT a problem in themselves, it's the frequency of these moments. We're currently 15 episodes in, and there's been a holy **** moment in a majority of the episodes. I felt it started to go downhill after episode five. They simply are predictable. Not predictable in what's going to happen mind you, but when. These shock moments are extremely effective tools in story telling, I feel that AoT abuses them however. I like the shocks the series brings, it's the sheer number of them. It takes away from what the shock should be, because I know it'll be coming.

Despite all this I really do believe this is a good series. And up through episode 5 I would give it a 10/10. There's enough going on to keep me coming back every week and for me to enjoy it every week. I just feel like it's being held back by the story telling slightly.",10,9,"Jul 24, 2013"
9,One of the most beautiful shows ever made,"Attack on Titan is simply one of the most beautiful but tragic, exciting but philosophical stories ever brought to screen.

The characters are both heroic and flawed, complex but naive, strong yet vulnerable.

Without spoilers it's difficult to describe AOT, but be prepared for the fact that once you think you have figured this story out, it will shift, but not for the sake of shock value or catching out the audience, the shifts are brilliant and thought provoking, encouraging the audience to reevaluate what they have seen and what they presume comes next.

All in all, this anime, the characters and the story are truly beautiful and will stand the test of time as one of the best 'tv shows' ever made.

If only Hollywood valued creativity, artistic vision and risk taking in the same way!",6,4,"Nov 7, 2023"
10,An eternal masterpiece,"Penetrating the beginning and the end.. I did not watch this kind of animation ever. Writer organized whole stories tightly. Perfect Organization.

I am 48 years old. Furthemore, there were almost 1,000 anime film watched for 3 decade.

I am able to insist with no doubt. This masterpiece is greatest of all in anime world. I am concerned I am going not to watch this kind of anime before dying. Who can create these kinds of epic with philosophy that penetrates the essence of humanity? I am big pan of UC Gundam series, however those stuff could not make me sleepless like this.

If you want to fine masterpiece of your life, watch this.",6,4,"Nov 13, 2023"
10,The best anime I have ever seen.,"This is God's creation. His existence is undoubtedly crushing for other anime. Entering the story of Malai Chapter, it begins to sublimate, which is the most profound and thorough film and television work to describe the truth of war, with a broad vision of the pattern, and to reflect on the curse of war which has been attached to the bone like maggots since human beings. In fact, the story has come to a successful end for me, and it doesn't matter what happens again, because like the real world, there is only reincarnation without an end. Can think of the same great works can be counted on one's fingers, from 90 years ago, ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" is one of them, I believe that the giants who understand Attack on Titan have a tolerant heart, why care who has different views from you and who has one star review?",6,4,"Feb 22, 2023"

10,"One of the best TV shows of all time, period.","I've watched the best shows ever produced, breaking bad, the wire, the sopranos etc, this ranks up there as one of the greatest shows ever produced, anime or not.

Incredible plot, amazing world, tremendous characters, I haven't watched a lot of anime over the years but upon hearing constantly how good this was, I had to give it a try. This is the real deal. The word masterpiece gets thrown around too much now, but this is exactly that.

I watched expecting the plot to go one way and yet time and time again, it swept me aside and went the other way. Eren, Reiner, Levi, Erwin are some of the best characters to hit the screen. If you want an amazing show, give this a watch regardless of your preferences, this is exceptional.",5,3,"Dec 16, 2023"
9,Great manga turned into great anime,No content,5,3,"Aug 16, 2022"
10,Too good for TV,"If I could rate this 15/10, I would. This IS the best anime I have ever had the privilege of watching. There is slowness in the the show but it is for a reason. You have to watch this with all your attention. If not, you are going to miss vital tidbits that all relate to the crux of the overall story.

The Good: -AWESOME story -Excellent pacing -Good character development -Mind-blowing soundtrack

The Bad: -Those damn cliff-hangers. If you're engrossed in the episode (which you will find to be the case for most of them, that 22-min running time is going feel more like just 6 min.) -Having to wait for the next episode. They cannot release these things fast enough. At least with the 3rd season, you only really had to wait a few months. After the end of Season 2, I believe it was a wait of around a year. If you're itching to see what happens next, the wait can be agonizing. -Death of characters. As mentioned before, almost no characters are safe. There are some characters you begin to care about who appear for 2-3 episodes, then they kick the bucket. This makes things VERY unpredictable.

I will say again, this series is EPIC (And I thought Dragon Ball Z and Dragon Ball GT was epic). Had no idea there was a higher level of anime awesomeness to experience ;p",5,3,"Mar 27, 2019"

10,Is it the greatest work offered to humanity?,"Yes, this is indeed the greatest dramatic and epic work that contains a meticulously crafted plot and profound depth in the story. Every second you watch this work, it can deliver a visual, artistic, and intellectual ecstasy. It has strangely touched my soul, even though I'm not a fan of watching animations or anime, but it is truly exceptional compared to others. This work has provided me with a great psychological and emotional incentive, as if it has taken a significant part of my thoughts with its events, plot, and depth. In every image you see in the first season, it may be closely related to the fourth season. This is what truly impressed me, and it deserves a definite rating of 10/10.",5,3,"Jun 25, 2023"
10,This series.....,"Wow! The first time I saw this anime came from youtube algorithm. Back then, I saw titan chewing human mercilessly. Then came Eren. He was like the ordinary shonen MC. Screaming, yelling, and always have a shonen type eyes. Screaming that he will eradicate all the titan. Yes! Very typical shonen MC. I put my time then to watch this show through the end.

My mind was blown away by the plot twists, the message of this anime, the design character of each of the titan, the soundtracks that mesmerizing every single season, and many more. WIT and MAPPA really put their best effort to make this anime well deserved as it is now.

The conflicts in this show intrigued us as a human being to think, contemplate and choosing side who has benefit more. The narrative point is well established as well. If someone new to anime and want to watch the anime, this is the show that top tier. Yes not so many action sequences, but it is well delivered. Human being, love, sacrifices, family, tragic romances, degradation, slavery, and many more that can't be put in this review. Wow!",5,3,"Nov 13, 2023"

The show's storyline is just incredible, and sometimes you just can't stop watching.

There's a big plot twist at the end of season 3 that Kinda sucks, but season 4 is still great.

The animations and grafics are SO good, so the titans are actually a bit scary.

There are a few OVA episodes that arn't that good, but besides that, I enjoyed every episode.

Im not a big anime fan, but still loved it.

Definatly recommand.",5,3,"Apr 27, 2022"
9,Extremely Hooking,"I had my doubt about this show for awhile even after it was widely talked about after release. See, I never liked much anime. But after a YouTube clip caught my attention I decided to check it out. The very first episode inticed me and i found myself immediately wanting to watch the 2nd, then the 3rd, and you get my point. The script is well written along with the plot. It builds up great to make your eyes be wide open expecting dramatic story created through chaos and the human desperation for survival. The only thing the prevents me from putting down a 10/10 is that the English Dub is not the original and I have to look for the episodes of my language. Besides that, however, the show itself is absolutely and extremely hooking. 👍",5,3,"Oct 4, 2018"

9,Practically gold standard for anime,"This show succeeds in almost every way: it's addictive/ entertaining, it's wonderfully designed, the characters have depth, and most importantly the plot is developed so well that there's even a curiosity to the universe itself.

I wouldn't say it's perfect, as towards the beginning (and excluding the few couple episodes), there was a bit too much filler, but it's resolved towards the end and my attention was glued to the screen.

I absolutely love the way they toy with your perception of the main character after they know they've gotten you to like him - that was executed very, very well.

One gripe is that mid-way through, death seems undervalued for the majority of people you see dying. In that way it was a bit one dimensional, but I understand that it would've been hard to portray the war in greater depth.

Those are my only criticisms, really. Having it based on European lore is also a welcomed change, as you don't often see that in anime of this caliber.

10,Attack on titans,"Attack on titans is an animated Japanese series created by Hajime Isayama and directed by Tetsuño Araki in 2009. There are 4 seasons and 75 episodes. The series stars with Eren jäger, Mikasa Acherman, Armin Arlelt and Livaï and other characters like Jean and Historia.

The story is set in a world where humanity lives surrounded by immense walls to protect itself from the titans, it will be a struggle of humanity to reconquer their territories and thus unravel the mystery of the appearance of the titans and the outside world.

My opinion is that the series is great; For people who like to go for animated ! the series is captivating, the animated picture is super well-done and the characters are endearing.",3,1,"Mar 12, 2021"

9,The story starts with the gate to the sheeps being left open,"I am not sure if the creators of Attack on Titan intended the inference to the religious Sheep's Gate: a place where the people society didn't want were abandoned to. However considering the overall quality of this series, I wouldn't put it passed them. Especially as it works perfectly with the story being told.

This is one of the best television series I have ever seen. Not just anime, but of ALL of television. This is now the show I would rate closest to perfection, that I almost was considering giving it a 10.

It's amazing. It has Babylon 5 levels of earlier shown moments in the series becoming focal later on. It - is - AMAZING! (don't forget to watch the OVAs)

There are so many good things to say about this show. Choosing just one example. In season 1 when Eren says he's going to ""kill them all"", and we as the viewer are full on board with him.... Eren hasn't changed in season 4. He's still the same as in season 1 in his vindication when we were cheering him on to get his revenge.

WE as the viewers changed by that time by being aware of the entire story.

10,Freaking awesome that i am sobing 👌,"""Attack on Titan"" is an emotionally gripping series that left me completely shattered. The show's ability to create a visceral and immersive world filled with complex characters is unmatched. The intense action sequences are beautifully animated and add to the emotional depth of the story. The show's exploration of themes such as loss, trauma, and the human condition is both thought-provoking and heart-wrenching. The finale of the series left me sobbing, as it tied together all the loose ends in a way that was both satisfying and devastating.

10,Share my opinion,"The best anime in my life,and I will not change my opinion",3,1,"Feb 7, 2021"
9,"Great concept that is well-expressed, minor let-downs","Attack on titan is another awesome anime. It centres around a dystopian future (although my brother is convinced that it is set in the past - I really don't know which it is but I assume it is set in the future) where gigantic humans called Titans brutally eat humans for fun. The ups of this anime include the emotional backstory which makes the audience immediately connect with the characters. So the concept is great. I love how it's got - or if it doesn't, that anyone can form - an ambiguous moral; like maybe (and these are just my theories) it's saying that humanity is ""killing"" itself (titans (i.e. giant humans) killing smaller humans) by all the things we are doing, literally when you think of global warming, all the wars we have with one another, also maybe it's poking fun at the notion of social class - particularly, we still have imperial systems and lots of poor people maybe it's saying in this day and age such a thing is unacceptable and incredibly backward compared to how much we have otherwise advanced as a species.

I may be overanalysing but I do love how the anime itself is so ambiguous that I am able to interpret it in such manners.

Apart from that, the characters are good although I cannot entirely empathise with them since, despite their emotional backstory, the main characters are too ""unflawed"" - Eren is so entirely fearless, Mikasa is so perfect in her fighting ability and so level-headed. Armin is the most relatable as despite being incredibly intelligent, he is not a skilled fighter and has some fear and so, is flawed.

The only real downside, however, is that I believe that most episodes are dragged out way too long with insignificant scenes taking up most of the episodes. After the episode has ended you realise that barely anything has actually happened in the episode. Certain situations are drawn out over several episodes when they could easily fit into a couple episodes. Some flashbacks are also way too long, taking up most of the episode, and you end up forgetting that the whole thing was just a flashback and are confused when it finishes (or maybe it's just me).

So overall, the anime has a great concept and has expressed it well. However, the episode structure and certain aspects of the characters are what has made me give it 9/10 instead of a full 10/10.",3,1,"Apr 9, 2016"

10,Feel the Conflict: The Final Battle between Humans and Titans,"The anime series of Attack on Titan is finally coming to an end. While the story has its flaws, it remains incredibly engaging. In its fourth season, the narrative takes a new perspective, challenging viewers to consider a contradictory point of view. This shift captures the essence of the story: Those who are always casting their stones those of whom the stone always being throwed in between them is a fence of cage, if their view is being changed justice will appear its fangs.""

This change in perspective left me feeling confused and saddened. The author forced me to think about the other side-the enemy. Ultimately, a pervasive threat forces the two sides of the wall to join forces and fight against the relentless Titans. The dramatic confrontation filled me with enthusiasm, yet witnessing the end of the story and the demise of beloved characters left me profoundly saddened.

Attack on Titan continues to captivate audiences with its intense storytelling, complex characters, and shocking plot twists. By exploring compelling themes and utilizing symbolism, the series raises profound questions about the human condition. Whether you're a fan of dystopian settings, epic battles, or philosophical narratives, Attack on Titan offers something for everyone. So, gear up and join the fight against the Titans in this thrilling and immersive world.",4,2,"Dec 3, 2023"
10,titans invade earth and humans are defending human race to save it from extinction,"i loved it !! everything about this show is incredible ..the story is exciting ..however, the only thing that was a little disturbing is the fact that they speak to themselves a LOT ! other than that , this show is amazingly unique..you feel every event as if it's happening in real life !!when i watched the first episode , i couldn't stop myself from watching the rest of the episodes .. i finished the whole series in 8 hrs !!! they should make a second season !!however, the movie was disappointing ..if you're an anime fan or an addict (like me ) this show will blow your mind and i promise that you'll love it ..we need anime shows like this one ...hope you guys like this show the same way i did .",4,2,"Feb 10, 2016"
10,ATTACK ON TITAN: A Thrilling Survival Fantasy Anime,"ATTACK ON TITAN (2013-2023) What an epic anime & manga! It seems in the realm of anime fans, people either LOVE or HATE AoT. I've heard those that complain about this series, about the messy art style or the slowly ""degrading"" plot, seemingly abrupt character changes, the severe brutality of some scenes, or the frequent emotional outburst scenes, or the even the ending etc. And while I do acknowledge some of those are true, to some extent, this series was so very cool in most other ways. It was truly an amazing, gripping and thrilling anime. The world building for example, and the overall fantasy concept is really brilliant.

The action / fight scenes are incredibly epic and gripping, the emotional scenes are intense and upsetting (perhaps a bit too frequent but it does immerse you into the show), characters are all very interesting and well developed / designed, the weapon / travel system is super cool, and c'mon, the concept of giant titans running around eating people is very intense premise for an anime and made for a highly energetic and emotional show. This is a top notch dark epic fantasy series.

Overall, this series was super cool and engaging, but I'm currently uncertain about where the latest (final) season is going. I have a few episodes left so we shall see. Regardless of the ending, the anime is super awesome, one of the best I've seen in fact, (I've seen MANY). Whether in story, concept, characters, design and music. Give it a watch if you like dark brutal action and intense epic fantasy concepts.

10,Almost perfect,"I dont know what to say without spoiling the story, because it is so complex , but i will try.

When i started watching AoT ,it was only my second anime , and i didnt know what to expect. This show has one of the best world building, one of the best character developments i have seen. There are so many twists and turn that are foreshadowed , but i never was coming. AoT has the potential to be a cultural phenomenon ,like Braking bad and the good days of GoT. All i can hope is this show gets an adaptation that does it justice someday so it can reach even more people.

To anyone wondering if they should watch this please do, one of the most complex stories of modern time.",4,2,"Nov 6, 2023"

10,The greatest anime,"The greatest anime of all time. A boy named Eren Yeager sees his mother being eaten by a multimeter titan, after which he is determined to take revenge on the perpetrators. He lives in a Japanese city, which is walled off from those very titans. He takes a course where he is taught how to use balloons and a harpoon, and there he makes friends. A very long and intense plot, at the end you begin to appreciate each character, and it becomes very pathetic when they die. The story with the titans is more interesting than it seems. It involves the boy's father and the basement that Eren was forbidden to go down into. This anime has grabbed the attention of millions of fans from all over the world.",4,2,"Jan 19, 2022"

10,Attack on titan is peak fiction,"Thats right there is peak fiction and story telling, from beginning to end both anime and manga is goated, hajime isayama really written and draw a decade top fiction. And mappa really gave life to manga with its top notch visuals.

The show is not biased one can't take stand whether what he did is true or he is wrong the writer leaved it to viewers and manga reader perspective.

Every character in their pov thought that what they are doing is good and they thought they are protecting their family or race/ country by killing others.. just like in reality in a country if there is war a soldier would do anything to protect their country /people in their perspective they are protecting their country and following orders but there so called enemies has also family/ thing they had to protect its an endless cycle of hatred..",4,2,"Nov 6, 2023"
10,Tears to the end of the greatest animation work in history,"After 10 years of greatness, here is the end to the greatest animation work in the history, an animation that tells us wars is not the solution of solving problems , we must leave in peace .

Many thanks to whoever was part of this wonderful work and you idea about it will remain in our minds forever

After years from now i hope that we will find an equal work to this masterpiece and i think there won't be one.

Everything was perfect not a single episode was bad i really enjoyed every single minute of the story and the whole work.

Words are not enough for you and again many thanks to you.

Good bye AOT.",4,2,"Nov 5, 2023"

The show masterfully weaves together a complex narrative, delivering a gripping tale that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats.

It showcased the harsh realities of war, sacrifice, and the complex nature of human beings. The ending may not have provided a conventional ""happy ending,"" but it stayed true to the dark and morally ambiguous tone of the series. It left room for interpretation and reflection, provoking thought and discussion among viewers.

10,Not everyone can actually understand the story,"Firstly, sorry about my bad English, as it is not my mother tongue...

An anime that deserves its high rank. The art is unique, and it expresses the cruel world that the Isayama is trying to show us, as viewers. The storyline is not understandable to everyone, and even an adult may takes a considerable amount of time to fully get it.

Personally, in an anime, I care more about the storyline than the art. However, the story of this anime contains full of plot twists, so I don't want to review too much about it here. The only thing I can say is that it is about all aspects of our real life, including love, hate, family, brothers, and most importantly to me, politic, etc.

The art of the series is quite better than the original manga version, especially when Mappa took responsibilities for this. The VAs are really good at showing the emotion of their characters, and also their characteristics, especially for the main character, who has a lot to tell us.

The anime is perfect for people who cares about either the art (and the sound), or the story. Both will not disappoint them.",4,2,"Feb 8, 2022"
10,One of the greatest,"This might be the best anime with strong story without dragging it unnecessarily. The ending was pretty realistic for me regarding with the ideas of certain characters.

Soundtrack plays a crucial role in building powerful moments and also making it memorable. The animation was mind blowing which was still a surprise from Mappa studio . Even though the animation studio was struggling with so many projects, they didn't try to reduce their quality . The series already was famous for having twists and turns in every season and they didn't miss that in final part. It's surprising how the writer maintained the quality of story in every part .",4,2,"Nov 6, 2023"

10,A modern masterpiece,"""Attack on Titan"" is a classic that will be remembered by everyone. It broke numerous anime records and is one of the few, if not the only anime, to become as popular as mainstream non-animated shows. It was the most in-demand show at one point, and you can't say it wasn't deserved. It has everything you need: an amazing pilot episode, a perfect soundtrack, incredible characters, one of the best plot twists ever, and a great finale.

The character development is on another level as well. From Eren starting as a basic protagonist to becoming one of the best and most complex main characters ever, to Floch transforming into a merciless and fearless commander. It also features one of the best introverted characters (Levi Ackerman) and an underrated female cast.

There is so much to say about this show, but words still won't do it justice. That's why the best way is to sit and enjoy it from beginning to end. Thank you for all the memories, AOT. You will never be forgotten!",4,2,"Nov 6, 2023"

10,Words cannot describe the gratitude I feel for this anime,"The story, the characters, the lessons, the ideas, the animation, the imagination, the music, the feelings... all has been an insane journey of inspiration, hope, desperation. For many of us that we've been following it for all these years, it is way more than this. It is not just the anime/manga itself, but all the bonding we got because of it with other people, the soundtracks accompanying us on those hard days, the anticipation of the new episodes, the beautiful life lessons that it gave us. Growing up alongside the characters, maturing together with what life was bringing to everyone in real life, to keep going because that's what life is about. Tatakae <3.",4,2,"Nov 5, 2023"

10,It really is a masterpiece,"This tv show is just amazing. You cannot say otherwise. The story, the characters, the animation, the music - everything is from another dimension. Some fights are just so epic, you will stay on the edge of your seat. Some dialogs are so good, it could be a wand tattoo and you would be proud of it. And the plot, oh my, that is just first class. Some say Game of Thrones had the best plot twist, they had not watch this show. And honestly, what did Game of Thrones delivered after season 4? Nothing! And this is the major advantage of AOT: It gets better with every season! Writing this review the anime is in the middle of the final season and oh my, it delivered so much already. It is fire!

I pray that they will give us a movie from AOT, like the demon slayer tv show got. It would be so epic to watch this masterpiece on a big screen ( and yes i watched it on my beamer at home so it is already really big, but still).

This TV show deserves every praise it got and so much more. It is on another level, not only comparing it to animes but also to other tv shows.",4,2,"May 26, 2021"

The plot twists were everything. I loved everything about this anime since the beginning to the end. If you are conflicted about watching this thinking it might not be worth it I'm here to tell you do give this one a try and more so if you are a new anime watcher. Attack on Titan makes it to my top 3 very easily and will always hold that spot.",4,2,"Sep 9, 2023"

10,"Review #86 - This show keeps getting better, really, and that is my titular statement...","Ergo, the first thing I have to tell you before you stop reading. All my oriental friends raved about this show, and that always puts me off a bit (the number of people, not anything else. I mean, I am naturally disinclined to go mainstream, so when I DO praise a mainstream, you know it's really good) You start with a bunch of kids with naive ideals and philosophies. And they dream and daydream a lot. You will see them do that less as they grow and mature, as we all do and probably agree we should. By this point, I have seen nothing impressive.

Granted, they are kids so they will need to learn. And they do, fast, and hard. The world they live in is given to you straight, or that's what they make you think for the first few episodes. Mankind are hunted by titans bla-bah and try to fight them with ""maneuvre gear""- wire grapple combined with gas propulsion, and then cut the titan's weak spot with something nice and sharp, which Japan has always had, to be fair, although the cultural setting of this last surviving major city of mankind seems to be set in the likeness of post-medieval central Europe.

What is nice is that the wire grapples and gas propulsions are technologies we currently have and it is realistic to master their use to the level on the show, given a generation of human devote to the training and accepting that a mistake can mean you splat yourself to death. Only when I nearly finished the series I realized the movement resembles fighter aircrafts, if you are into that sort of thing (and it's also because those who are really good at it only showed up then).

The show tells you from the start the kid's mother gets eaten, and it doesn't get easier from there. Every time you think they are beginning to get things on the track of wrapping it all up, another load of hell pops out of nowhere. In fact, that is the only thing predictable about this show.

In such a bleak world, morals lean a lot more towards the ability to survive, especially collectively, meaning some people are willing so sacrifice themselves or a smaller number of others to save many. And you see everyone are on different levels of agreement of acceptance towards that and struggle with each other over the subject. Cowards arguing with heroes and people realizing they are one and not the other in face of danger, etc, etc. But all characters act logically and reasonably to that end for a very enjoyable watch.

Did I mention the kids daydream a lot? Some of these dreams seem to have a deja vu or precognition element to it or actually altered reality - Boy dreamt of being given a key and woke up with a key which he did not seem to have before. A fragment of a dream might paint a person 1 picture and a longer version of the dream later reveals a completely different story.

The series portrays a large city and it does not disappoint and in how new characters and elements come into the life of the main characters. In fact, the kids work their way into more and more complex plots and schemes. And they are also in the process of researching and discovering more about the titans they fight. And there turns out to be a whole load of interesting ideas about how the author invented these titans.

The people who appeared good guys may seems like they are not, but turn out they actually are, just not letting on the stuff they knew. Or maybe they are not, because the story is clearly not all finished after series 1 and that's the only bad thing.

This is the best blend of survival horror, friendship drama, super-power-kid, sci-fi, war of subterfuge, alternative world apocalypse a lot of us have ever seen. OK, the friendship and subterfuge elements are not THAT good, only just ""great"".",7,6,"Aug 29, 2014"
9,Attacking The Heart.,"Anime. The new found years of this age are built on hype, overselling, or hit-and-miss events. As much as was built up for this anime, I can whole heartedly say, it met how much it was said out to be. My opinion does contain some bias, but like all, pros and cons are present. The main con for this, was developing characters, but at the same time it built around that, and crushed walls like this with ease. A captivating story line, a brilliant and beautiful execution. Eagerly, the plot, characters, and writing had me hooked. It divulges and jumps into a part of humanity many shun, but exposes it like a bleeding wound. It barely disappointed me, but pulled at my heartstrings.

I sum this anime into a morality setting. In the darkest black, presides the greatest of all light.",7,6,"Oct 11, 2013"

10,Perfection,"This anime in my opinion can't be put into words, everything from the setting to character development heck even the soundtrack is top quality. The animation is beautiful and the actions scenes is executed perfectly. The episodes always leaves you with suspense wondering what is to happen next keeping you at the verge of your seat. Every episode leaves with shivers down your back. This anime leaves you speechless and makes you wonder to what happens next in every episode. The different characters that are portrayed during the duration of the anime are very realistic, they all have their own typical personalities that gives you something to admire about. The voice acting in this anime is just top notch, every emotion can be felt by their use of words and their tone. This anime has got to be one of the best of its kind.",6,5,"Oct 12, 2013"
10,The best anime of all time,"This anime is pretty awesome. It may even be the greatest anime of all time. The graphics and music are top class. The story itself is so thrilling to the extent that you may find your self screaming out of surprise in the middle of some episodes.

This anime is so emotional. It is indeed not for those with weak hearts. However, if you started watching this anime, continue it to the end because things tend to get more and more exciting as you go on especially in the last 8-10 episodes.

I have to say that I cannot wait for the next season.

P.S.: If you finished the anime, you are likely to feel very much excited and consider reading the manga. I suggest not doing so because you will definitely miss the awesome graphics and the brilliant soundtracks

If I could give a rating above 10, I would have done that",6,5,"Nov 24, 2013"

10,Best TV series I have ever seen,"I love Japanese animation but I only finished watching few animes. Most of them portray stuff I really don't like; for example, robots or too much fantasy. When I first saw trailer of Attack on Titan, I thought ""pfff that's so cheesy, humans fighting giants.. I am not going to watch this"". However, in all Top 10 lists of anime Attack on Titan was among the leaders and people said it has best soundtrack, best plot, best animation, best action scenes... So, I said ""ok I will give it a try"".

After first episode I was amazed by very well made animation and epic music in the background. 4 more episodes and I was hooked. Only after finishing all episodes I realized what masterpiece I had just saw. For about a month I was obsessed about it: I saw all the OVAs, rewatched my favorite scenes over and over again.

Attack on Titan truly has best animation, best action scenes and most importantly best soundtrack. Some people say pacing is too slow or characters are too emotional. But, wouldn't you be emotional if you lived in a world where people are eaten right in front of you?

MOST IMPORTANTLY this show is not only for brainless popcorn eaters, Attack on Titan reminded me some serious truths about the world WE LIVE IN: the biggest monsters are not 'evil creatures' but humans; sometimes an individual must take an initiative if he/she feels stronger than other team members; always try to escape from your 'walls' that surround you, maybe you are afraid to change the job you don't like or afraid what other people think about you, JUST GET OUT OF YOUR COMFORT ZONE - you will suffer but in the end it will be worth it.

Thank You, Hajime Isayama and WIT studios for creating this awesome TV show. For me it was a real masterpiece of art.",6,5,"Jul 23, 2015"
10,V good,"OK so I've read a few of these reviews and none of them seem to have been in summary of the entire first season as the season has recently finished this made the reviewer quite uninformed in some cases as they haven't seen it all. I have. One review in particular had the entire premise of the story and main character off point because they were only 8 episodes in.

AoT is set in a ridiculous distopian landscape with vast implications and extremely believable characters. The scale of the world the characters long for means that it amplifies the sense that we are only seeing the ""pen"" analogy which is evident throughout the show.

The characters are brought to life through insightful and 3D monologues and almost none are without both light and darkness ( with the exception perhaps of Mark who is only in the show for a small time ) the character development is extensive and you get to know the characters through their actions also

Overall this is the most promising anime of all time and I forbid anyone to let is pass them by.

My partner was away for a couple of days on business and I happened to do a search on top TV shows or something of that sort. The summary sounded really very interesting. While I was a little hesitant to watch something with subtitles, I cannot remember the last time I have been so entertained, so engrossed and so compelled to watch the next episode of any series.

Brilliant show, incredible theme tune and just a wonderful example of storytelling.",7,7,"May 13, 2014"
10,Best written story of all time,"Give it a chance trust me you wont regret it. It might start off as a basic plot but the story has way more behind then meets the eye.

And a bonus, the sound track is absolutely amazing.",5,4,"Feb 26, 2022"
10,Best Anime I've Seen In Years,"I love this show, I only started watching this probably a week ago and I couldn't stop watching since. I love all of the characters an how their emotions and characteristics are presented, especially Armin in the beginning. The characters, hated or loved, are memorable and you get very attached to the story and what their going through.The whole show is extremely fast-paced with no times I felt bored in 25 episodes. The last show that came close to this is Fullmetal Alchemist but it still isn't as good as this. There were many times I hadn't at all seen the next part coming which increased the fear and excitement of it. The titans are a different kind of monster that could only be found in an anime. I would recommend this to anyone who likes a fast-paced adventure.",5,4,"May 23, 2015"
10,Worth the watch,"Let me just set something straight. I am not a fan of anime, never cared for it really. One of my friends suggested me this show saying I would enjoy it. I watched the first episode and did not like it and he told me to give it one more try so I did. I loved it way more then. I love violence so it was a quick catch after I gave it another try. The characters are probably the best part in this show. It has an awesome concept and nice voice actors. I am only half way through it and I am all for it. Its in my top three favorite shows along with Supernatural and Revolution. If you are having thoughts to watch this show or not, do it. Its worth the watch. Take it from someone who is not a big fan of anime. This show is also getting another season which is awesome.",5,4,"May 11, 2015"
10,Epitome of what you can call an Epic story,"Am one of those guys that doesn't get moved easily, in fact I will go as far as to tell you that I didn't blink when I watched the titanic. If you are an anime/animation lover, then am doing you a favour; drop whatever you are doing and go and watch this anime, nothing else could shake you more... Here is a list of reasons of why; I have never watched any other anime that captures you to a depth where you actually feel the pain of the protagonist there are parts where you feel utterly confused and mind blown, saying anymore might over do it so all I have left to say is make it a top of your watch list and please give feedback I want your opinion too",5,4,"Jan 18, 2015"
9,Absolutely Amazing Anime,"Attack on Titan (Shingeki no Kyojin) is easily one of the best, if not THE best TV show of all time. Everything from the characters, to the setting, the the titans themselves are perfectly done. The atmosphere the show provides is also very noteworthy with it's music, camera angles, and animation. The show takes place in the year 850, where creatures called titans showed up on earth. They basically eat people and are extremely hard to kill. The remaining humans built several walls to keep the titans out. Needless to say, the show starts when something goes wrong and humanity must be saved. The show may seem to have a pretty basic idea, but it is so well done and has plenty of twists to keep the viewer on the edge of their seat",5,4,"Aug 31, 2015"
10,"This anime is spot on in terms of content, drama, mystery, intensity and artwork!!!","Before actually watching this anime, I already saw a few scenes of it when my brother was watching it in his room and for me that time it wasn't really that appealing... Okay giant crazy looking people running over a town ""Godzilla"" like so I wasn't into it, I thought it could just be one of those anime that gets boring over time... so I didn't pay attention. Now when my girlfriend suggested watching it together, knowing she's a fan of some really good anime, I said sure let's watch it. Watching the first episode I easily got hooked! Hooked at the story hooked at the characters and the artwork is just amazing, you won't miss out on the emotions the characters are having... I got chills watching those creepy looking Titans storming through the wall! The content, the character build up is just compelling not to mention the emotions that will burst as you watch the twists and turns. The voice actors (Japanese) made it more dramatic and profound making it more relatable and touching. This is not like some of those kid anime that lacks content and just drags along until it looses the interest of its audience. Even the behaviour of humans in this world are just honest and interesting in a way that the author captured the political conflicts and human relations that's happening in the real world and put it in this world where people are the ants trapped inside a wall looking for a way to reclaim the world that was theirs. The story is just UNIQUE and I like that the author made something that's not about ZOMBIES, or NINJAS, or SAYANS.... etc. This is like a first of it's kind and that makes it even more interesting and UNPREDICTABLE! There's a lot of mysteries going on in the story, a lot of cliff hangers on each episode! This anime is extremely recommended! I know for sure that this review won't do enough justice for the anime, so go and watch it yourselves, if you have to subscribe, this is worth subscribing for. I can't wait for the next season! I might just go ahead and read the manga...",5,4,"Sep 15, 2015"
10,Simply EXQUISITE,"Taking aside the top-notch animation, this is one of the best audiovisual works in regards of storytelling I've ever seen, and the one that has, without exaggeration, the best character development EVER. The way that you're able to see (specially after rewatching) the effects that this war has on the characters as they grow up is unparalleled to any other. The only bittersweet thing from this anime is that it ruined all the other animes for me. This is just on a league of its own. I'd rate 11/10 if possible!",5,4,"May 13, 2021"

9,The chronicles of Eren Yeager,"A gigantic effort indeed, from both content and implementation point of view, however not completely clean from errors so can not reach the top score.

To be precise would say that 1st and 4th seasons value 8, while 2nd and 3rd are much better and I would say 10.

In the first season Eren pursue his revenge, he is pretty monothematic (this I don't like), moreover the situation is kind out of the blue and feels not so realistic, however the animation, design from technical point of view is excellent as well as first opening theme.

In the 2nd and 3rd season the characters are more grown up and they start driving a bit the story (instead of being just shaken by it), these 2 seasons are really good.

In the 4th season the story start to twist too much, moreover one of key characters who is introduced here is totally fake (Gabi) and example of the too much trying of overexpressing characters.",5,4,"Dec 22, 2022"

10,"Awesome action, terrific music and a gripping story!","I've been watching some anime over the years. It all started with Naruto, grew better with Bleach, and hit a high-note with Death Note. I had a hard time finding an anime that was on the same caliber as the last two.

Then suddenly I stumbled upon this. First episode: blew me away. You're hooked from around the middle of the first episode. It just gets better from there! The story is original and exciting, with some great characters (although I feel that Eren is a bit underdeveloped. He feels a little shallow and flat). I rushed through the first season within days.

The action is awesome, and the dynamics of the gear they use, and everything else, is ridiculously well thought out and explained. You can see that the creators have thought this well through.

And last, but not least: The music! It's so grand and epic it can't be explained in words! You just gotta watch it and listen. It makes you wanna stand up and fight whatever's next to you. Be that your computer or your dog.

I sincerely hope the second season and live action movie will live up to the expectations that the first season has created!",6,6,"Feb 22, 2014"
10,One of my favourites,"I am not a very big fan of anime. I watched pokemon and dragon ball z when I was younger and not a whole lot else. I saw this show on netflix as a recommendation and thought ""why not"". I'm not much of an anime fan by any stretch. However, this show made me a fan. The non-linear storytelling, the epic story, and everything else made this amazing. Not to mention how well done the music is. It reminds me of Game of Thrones with how no character is safe from elimination, the non-linear storytelling is somewhat similar to Breaking Bad, and the animation brings beautiful artistic and cinematic sequences to your screen. I beg that you at least watch the first episode and you will be hooked. If you aren't hooked then, finish ""part 2"" or whatever is next in that segment of episodes. Please give this show a chance!",6,6,"May 9, 2014"
10,Time to break your stereotypes. This is the real deal,"I always had a very bad stereotype on anime, and stereotypes are there for a reason. But this is unlike any movie or show I've ever seen before. I've never said a show had amazing character development or great writing until watching this. Hajime Isayama is here to show the west what Horror is, and it's not the easy suspense you into jump-scare tactics. This is legitimate and intriguing horror done well.

The show remains consistent and you can count the show's ""slow/boring"" parts on one finger. Isayama redefines cliffhangers and twists as modern culture knows them.

How do you make sword combat cool and original? You give the person special gear attached to the waist that allows them to ""swing"" short distances. There's no shortage of action in this anime. Now is the time to step into the world of anime if you never have before.

Horror. Hopelessness. Watch it. It's a show you don't want to miss and one that you will never forget.",6,6,"May 21, 2014"
10,One for the ages!,"I had heard a lot of great things about Attack On Titan for quite a while but, because i am now an older person, i didn't rush towards it like i would have done in the past. Also, most animes that made a fuss recently were a disappointment to my more matured character.

Anyway, i stumbled on to it some way and i decided to watch it and find out why my younger cousins were freaking out about this. Well, i have to say that this is a master piece.

This one of these shows that make it impossible to turn the TV off. You always want more and more. The plot is great, the animations are wonderful, characters are complex and spot on. I will even say that this anime goes straight to my top 5 all time and it's definitely the best i have seen since Death Note.

The only thing that i dislike about animes like that is... the fact that they come to and end and then you have to wait and pray the lord for whomever is responsible to decide about the realization of a sequel as soon as possible.",6,6,"May 31, 2014"
10,"Wonderful anime, watch it now!","In general, I don't watch too much anime. I've seen all of Heroic Age, and if Avatar: The Last Airbender counts (not the atrocious movie) then that too. This show was completely unknown to me until an anime junkie friend of mine mentioned it. When I noticed it on netflix I began watching it, and it blew me away. Some of these other reviews complain about the pacing, and while I agree that to the viewer tuning in weekly for each new episode pacing is a huge problem, for the user who can view the entire season in a day the pacing is inconsequential. Many episodes end in cliffhangers, or seem like they are just filler story in-between episodes. This is why I recommend that people watch this show in increments of 3-4 episodes at once. DVRing them and going on a binge or using netflix is the way to get maximum enjoyment of this show. Otherwise, the short episode length and frequent filler/cliffhanger use could disappoint some people looking for a self-contained story each week.

Despite my small criticisms, this series is easily one of the best TV shows I have watched, anime or otherwise. The voice work is wonderful, and the animation is of great quality. Still frames are used frequently but don't feel out of place, save perhaps on one occasion. But the story... oh the story is incredible, and the world Isayama created is deep and intriguing, with death around every turn and the reality that things are much worse than they seem pervading every moment. The art design and characters seem realistic and normal, and not overly gritty despite the extreme amount of gore in this show, which personally I prefer, as it shows the contrast between how the characters wish the world was as opposed to how it is, unlike some other shows where everyone is just dark and depressed with a thousand different shades of grey covering a foreboding landscape. The characters themselves have interesting and unique personalities, and their actions consistently reflect that. Even those who are only featured briefly feel as though they are a part of the world, and hold your interest for the short time they appear. For English viewers, there are a few symbols and references to Japanese culture which you might not pick up on, but it isn't completely inaccessible to outsiders.

Overall, I recommend anyone with even a slight interest in anime to watch this, as well as just people who like a great story in general. Had me hooked immediately and i've watched season one at least three times through it's that good! 10/10!",6,6,"Apr 2, 2014"
10,Truly Outshines the Hype,"Attack on Titan, or Shingeki no Kyojin, is one of the biggest anime of 2013 and many have flocked to view all 25 episodes and peruse through all 50 chapters which has garnered the series terrific hype. Despite all of the hype surrounding Attack on Titan, it still manages to amaze and outshine almost all expectations one could have before watching the series. Attack on Titan takes place in a dystopian future where the world is infested with giant creatures known as Titans that devour humans on sight. Upon the arrival of these Titans, humanity retreated into a citadel protected by three walls. The first wall, the outermost wall, is Wall Maria and the second wall is Wall Rose. So far, these two walls are the most significant as most of conflict so far has occurred between these two walls or beyond the walls. The main character of the series is a 15 year old boy named Eren Jager, who has a powerful resolve to kill all of the Titans. While this is not a very realistic goal that he has, it still creates a strong will for him to continue on despite all of the deterrents that come his way. The story isn't too focused on Eren killing Titans which viewers will realize when they come to the fifth episode. This story is much more than that, it is a violent struggle about humanity clinging on to dear life by a thread.",6,6,"Oct 9, 2013"
10,The best anime to watch,"Great foreshadowing, best character development, Amazing animation. Truly one of the best pieces of fiction. Season 1 is a great start and gets the viewer hooked. The story is dark and intriguing making the viewer want to keep watching. Season 2 has a great plot twist and feelings. Season 3 brings the plot together and answers many questions while leaving some unanswered for the next season. The final season has some of the greatest twist and action in the whole show. The final episode especially has everything that makes the show great. With the moral and theme showing that history repeats itself. Can't recommend enough.",4,3,"Nov 8, 2023"

10,This has the best Stroyline,Really it's storyline is so amazing and mind blowing. After S4 my mind has crashed and Each episode still hypes me like when I was watching S1.

8,Awesome show!,"Here's a Japanese show, that i thought I'd make an appreciation post for, called Attack on Titan. 8.8 on IMDb, 94% on Rotten Tomatoes, 8.4 on AnimeList 96% on Google Reviews and several other 5/5 and 4.9/5 ratings.

--- The show is set in a different time in which, the citizens hide within a three-tiered, walled-off community that protects them from the Titans that live outside of it. There have been no Titan sightings in about a 100 years since the attack that nearly wiped out all of humanity, the threat still very much looms right outside their gates. And BOOM! All hell breaks loose. And trust me when i say this, but 'all hell breaks loose' is an understatement.

--- This show is like Game of Thrones (the good seasons) x Band of Brothers x The Witcher x Assassin's Creed rolled into one show with some mindblowing music - hard rock and opera music. If you like serious storylines, brutal R-Rated war, and surprises (that I can't tell without spoiling this a little bit) you should TOTALLY watch this.

This show is available in English and in Japanese. Season 01 is on Netflix and Tubi Tv. All three seasons are on Hulu. The entire show has < 60 episodes, about 20 mins each. Trust me, you will NOT be disappointed.

--- Update: Bumping down a start for there this show is and has become in 2023.",4,3,"Aug 17, 2023"

10,BEST ANIME,"By far one of the best animes i've ever watched tho it's saddening to see it coming to an end.

If i'm being honest i started losing interest at the beginning of the second season but then the show makes a full recovery.

Overall it's a great anime and i highly recommend you give it a shot!",4,3,"Mar 13, 2022"
10,My first and the best,"Attack on Titan was the reason for me to start watching anime this provides everything a scoop more which is needed for a fictional series. God tier plot with amazing characters and top notch theme songs and OSTs. No matter what others think about the ending but this will provide the experience which may be impossible for any other anime to give. You can experience a different world of fiction that's so much of differ from what you saw until now. And I'm kinda feeling sad that it already ended.

It, is and will be my favourite anime forever. Eren will be my fav MC.

To the boy who sought freedom.... Goodbye....",4,3,"Nov 5, 2023"

10,Hands down the best anime ever created.,"I have to write my review in caps to emphasize how amazing this anime is: HANDS DOWN THE BEST ANIME EVER CREATED, and I have seen all the greats. My favorite anime before this was Berserk but this anime takes the cake. The DRAMA and EMOTION you get watching this is BREATH TAKING. The first episode and 4th are TRAUMATIZING! and that's what I look for when i watch TV/Movies, is the CHILL you get down your SPINE when you go ""holy sh*t"".

I have read the manga and this anime is one of those rare cases when the anime is actually better than the manga. The dramatic scenes are portrayed better in the anime. I don't care if anime is not your thing. This is a must. For everyone 14+.",7,8,"Jan 29, 2014"
9,Epic series! A must watch for all,"Attack on Titan grips you from its first episode and continues to surprise you as it moves on. It has a large roster of characters who are developed throughout the entire series, but the focus are the three friends; Eren, Armin and Mikasa. The story follows their journey fighting in the last resistance against the nightmarish creatures called Titans who have literally devoured the majority of mankind and pushed them to extinction.

Attack on Titan gets really epic at certain moments. Couple that with the best soundtrack I've heard in an anime, and this series gets the adrenaline pumping. The action sequences are lengthy and well made, mixing traditional 2D animation with 3D CGI. Overall animation is solid throughout, and really beautiful at times.

My only complain is that at certain times the pace of the story comes to a crawl. But its well made up for later on, so its nothing serious by any means.

This is an easy recommendation to anyone remotely interested in anime's but I strongly suggest this to one's who are NOT into anime. If this series doesn't appeal you, then no anime will.",5,5,"Dec 6, 2013"
10,A Must See,"This was the second anime I ever watched (Death Note being the first) and that was before I was the anime fan I am now. However from the first episode this show had me hooked. A friend recommended to me, I was hesitant at first (I thought it would be non stop action) but this friend and I were close so I decided to watch it for his sake. I've now tried to get other friends in into the show. First of all, let's talk about the tech. The animation is some of the best I've seen in a long time (now having watched more anime I can appreciate it even more). And it's not just the animation. The soundtrack is truly amazing and helps add to the show. Now let's discuss the characters. I've seen reviews complaining about how the protagonists are teenagers, or how Eren is moody and stuff of that sort. Now, I think there is a reason that this main characters are teenagers and this reason is that the show's target audience is teenagers. Chances are, the writers want the audience to be able to relate to the main characters, and if the audience is mainly teenagers, than the main characters are most likely going to be teenagers. And Eren being moody would make sense, given that he is 15 years old. It's a great show, and I'd recommend it to anyone.",5,5,"Jun 25, 2015"
10,Masterpiece,"Man just recently finished the anime, what an AWESOME anime, I really hope for the 2nd season. My heart was beating, I got surprised, I even got the chills more than a few times, things that only very few anime has accomplished (on me at least). I give this a solid 10/10, I didn't really saw ANY flaw, good story, good animation, good pacing, and no fillers. It's worth to wait for the 2nd season, the manga doesn't show very well the 3D Maneuver Gear animations, reading the manga and then watching anime will make it uninteresting. I still have faith and crossing fingers for a second season soon, but please, PLEASE no fillers, this anime so far is PERFECT (for me), don't ruin it with fillers (BUT if the fillers are expeditions of the Recon Corps, with good fights, soundtrack, and animation, I can let it pass.)",6,7,"Sep 30, 2013"
10,"If you don't like aot, just read it","The main reasoning of people who don't like ""aot"" are the annoying characters, lots of drama and weird pacing of time.which is just the problem at first of the season but that make sense if you give it his time. This show really wants you to invest in it. And if you, I think you get what you want and love it. Because it explains everything the annoyness of character with help of drama and details which is so good and you'll love it, their motives and their reasoning is so real. So, in the end the reasons why you don't like ""aot"" will become the reason why you like ""aot"" most.",3,2,"Mar 24, 2021"

When it came out back in 2013 I tried to watch the pilot 3 times and could never get past it. In 2020 I picked it back up, and what a wonderful decision that was. I loved every twist and turn, not a single arc bored or disappointed me. Here we are 10 years after the premier and I really believe this show has changed me.
